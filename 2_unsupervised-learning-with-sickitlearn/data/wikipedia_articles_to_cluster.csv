HTTP 404," HTTP 404  The 404 or Not Found error message is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was requested. The web site hosting server will typically generate a ""404 Not Found"" web page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors users can find on the web. A 404 error should not be confused with ""server not found"" or similar errors, in which a connection to the destination server could not be made at all. A 404 error indicates that the requested resource may be available again in the future; however, the fact does not guarantee the same content. Overview. When communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a web browser's request for a web page, with a numeric response code and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status code) message. In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as FTP and NNTP. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable ""reason phrase"". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase ""Not Found"" and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the ""Not Found"" phrase. A 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, a better response is to return a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through URL rewriting; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them. 404 errors should not be confused with DNS errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page. Custom error pages. Web servers can typically be configured to display a customised 404 error page, including a more natural description, the parent site's branding, and sometimes a site map, a search form or 404 page widget. The protocol level phrase, which is hidden from the user, is rarely customized. Internet Explorer, however, will not display custom pages unless they are larger than 512 bytes, opting instead to display a ""friendly"" error page. Google Chrome includes similar functionality, where the 404 is replaced with alternative suggestions generated by Google algorithms, if the page is under 512 bytes in size..  This is a violation of RFC 2616, which states that ""user agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user"". Another problem is that if the page does not provide a favicon, and a separate custom 404 page exists, extra traffic and longer loading times will be generated on every page view. Tracking/Checking 404 errors. A number of tools exist that crawl through a website to find pages that return 404 status codes. These tools can be helpful in finding links that exist within a particular website. The limitation, of course, is that these tools only find links within one particular website, and ignore 404s resulting from links on other websites. One way around this is to find 404 errors by analyzing external links. Another common method is tracking traffic to 404 pages using log file analysis. This can be useful to understand more about what 404s users reached on the site. However, log files can be somewhat complex to review. Another method of tracking traffic to 404 pages is using JavaScript-based traffic tracking tools. 404 page widgets. While many websites send additional information in a 404 error message—such as a link to the homepage of a website or a search box—some also endeavor to find the correct web page the user wanted. Extensions are available for some popular CMS to do this. In Europe, the NotFound Project encourages site operators to add a snippet of code to serve customised 404 error pages which provide data about missing children. Soft 404. Some websites report a ""not found"" error by returning a standard web page with a ""200 OK"" response code; this is known as a soft 404. Soft 404s are problematic for automated methods of discovering whether a link is broken. Some search engines, like Yahoo, use automated processes to detect soft 404s. Soft 404s can occur as a result of configuration errors when using certain HTTP server software, for example with the Apache software, when an Error Document 404 (specified in a .htaccess file) is specified as an absolute path (e.g. http://example.com/error.html) rather than a relative path (/error.html). Some proxy servers generate a 404 error when the remote host is not present, rather than returning the correct 500-range code when errors such as hostname resolution failures or refused TCP connections prevent the proxy server from satisfying the request. This can confuse programs that expect and act on specific responses, as they can no longer easily distinguish between an absent web server and a missing web page on a web server that is present. In July 2004, the UK telecom provider BT Group deployed the Cleanfeed content blocking system, which returns a 404 error to any request for content identified as potentially illegal by the Internet Watch Foundation. Other ISPs return a HTTP 403 ""forbidden"" error in the same circumstances. The practice of employing fake 404 errors as a means to conceal censorship has also been reported in Thailand and Tunisia. In Tunisia, where censorship is reportedly severe, people have become aware of the nature of the fake 404 errors and have created an imaginary character named ""Ammar 404"" who represents ""the invisible censor"". Slang usage. In 2008, a study carried out by the telecommunications arm of the Post Office found that ""404"" had become a slang synonym for ""clueless"" in the United Kingdom. Slang lexicographer Jonathon Green said that ""404"" as a slang term had been driven by the ""influence of technology"" and young people, but at the time, such usage was relatively confined to London and other urban areas.

Alexa Internet," Alexa Internet  Alexa Internet, Inc. is a California-based subsidiary company of Amazon.com which provides commercial web traffic data. Founded as an independent company in 1996, Alexa was acquired by Amazon in 1999. Its toolbar collects data on browsing behavior and transmits it to the Alexa website, where it is stored and analyzed, forming the basis for the company's web traffic reporting. As of 2013, Alexa provides traffic data, global rankings and other information on 30 million websites, and its website is visited by over 10 million people monthly. Operations and history. Alexa Internet was founded in 1996 by American web entrepreneurs Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat. The company's name was chosen in homage to the Library of Alexandria, drawing a parallel between the largest repository of knowledge in the ancient world and the potential of the Internet to become a similar store of knowledge. The company offered a toolbar that gave Internet users suggestions on where to go next, based on the traffic patterns of its user community. Alexa also offered context for each site visited: to whom it was registered, how many pages it had, how many other sites pointed to it, and how frequently it was updated. Alexa's operation includes archiving of webpages as they are crawled. This database served as the basis for the creation of the Internet Archive accessible through the Wayback Machine. In 1998, the company donated a copy of the archive, two terabytes in size, to the Library of Congress. Alexa continues to supply the Internet Archive with Web crawls. In 1999, Alexa was acquired by Amazon.com for about US$250 million in Amazon stock as the company moved away from its original vision of providing an ""intelligent"" search engine. Alexa began a partnership with Google in early 2002, and with the Open Directory Project in January 2003. In May 2006, Amazon replaced Google with Live Search as a provider of search results. In December 2006, they released Alexa Image Search. Built in-house, it was the first major application to be built on their Web platform. In December 2005, Alexa opened its extensive search index and Web-crawling facilities to third party programs through a comprehensive set of Web services and APIs. These could be used, for instance, to construct vertical search engines that could run on Alexa's own servers or elsewhere. In May 2007, Alexa changed their API to require comparisons be limited to three sites, reduced the size of embedded graphs shown using Flash, and added mandatory embedded BritePic ads. In April 2007, the lawsuit ""Alexa v. Hornbaker"" was filed to stop trademark infringement by the Statsaholic service. In the lawsuit, Alexa alleged that Hornbaker was stealing traffic graphs for profit, and that the primary purpose of his site was to display graphs that were generated by Alexa's servers. Hornbaker removed the term Alexa from his service name on March 19, 2007. On November 27, 2008, Amazon announced that Alexa Web Search was no longer accepting new customers, and that the service would be deprecated or discontinued for existing customers on January 26, 2009. Toolbar. Alexa ranks sites based primarily on tracking information of users of its toolbar for the Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome web browsers. The Alexa Toolbar includes a popup blocker, a search box, links to Amazon.com and the Alexa homepage, and the Alexa ranking of the site that the user is visiting. It also allows the user to rate the site and view links to external, relevant sites. In early 2005, Alexa stated that there had been 10 million downloads of the toolbar, though the company does not provide statistics about active usage. The Alexa Toolbar for Internet Explorer 7 has previously been flagged as malware by Microsoft Defender. A third-party-supplied plugin for the Firefox browser served as the only solution after Amazon abandoned its A9 toolbar. On July 16, 2007, Alexa released an official toolbar for Firefox called Sparky. Originally, webpages were only ranked amongst users who had the Alexa Toolbar installed, and could be biased if a specific audience subgroup was reluctant to take part in the rankings. This caused some controversy over how representative Alexa's user base was of typical Internet behavior, especially for less-visited sites. In 2007, Michael Arrington provided examples of Alexa rankings known to contradict data from the comScore web analytics service, including ranking YouTube ahead of Google. On April 16, 2008, many users reported dramatic shifts in their Alexa rankings. Alexa confirmed this later in the day with an announcement that they had released an updated ranking system, claiming that they would now take into account more data sources ""beyond Alexa Toolbar users"". A number of antivirus companies have assessed Alexa's toolbar. Symantec classifies the toolbar as ""trackware"", while McAfee classifies it as adware, a ""Potentially Unwanted Program."" McAfee Site Advisor rates the Alexa site as ""green"", finding ""no significant problems"" but warning of a ""small fraction of downloads ... that some people consider adware or other potentially unwanted programs."" 2009 redesign. On March 31, 2009, the Alexa website underwent a major redesign, offering new web traffic metrics, including average page views per each individual user, bounce rate, and user time on site. In the following weeks, Alexa added further features, including visitor demographics, clickstream and search traffic statistics. These new features were introduced in order to compete with other web analytics services, such as Compete.com and Quantcast. "
Internet Explorer," Internet Explorer 10  Internet Explorer 10 (IE10) is a version of the Internet Explorer web browser released by Microsoft in 2012, and is the default browser in Windows 8. IE10 expands on Internet Explorer 9 functionality with regard to CSS3 support, hardware acceleration, and HTML5 support. On 12 April 2011, Microsoft released the first ""IE10 Platform Preview"", which runs only on Windows 7 and later. While the second platform preview was also available for Windows 7 and later, the next four platform previews ran only on Windows 8. The first preview release came four weeks after the final release of Internet Explorer 9. IE10 reached general availability on 4 September 2012 as a component of Windows Server 2012. A preview of IE10 for Windows 7 was made available for download in November 2012. On 26 February 2013, Internet Explorer 10 was made available for download to all Windows 7 SP1 users. On Windows 8, it is divided into two editions with different user interfaces: a Metro app that does not support plug-ins and a traditional desktop application that retains plug-in support. On 64-bit computers, the Metro edition runs in 64-bit mode by default. The desktop edition can be run in 64-bit mode by enabling Enhanced Protected Mode. History. Internet Explorer 10 was first announced on 12 April 2011 at the MIX 11 conference in Las Vegas. In this conference, Microsoft showcased a demo version of Internet Explorer 10 along with a demo version of Windows 8. On the same day, a Platform Preview of Internet Explorer 10 was released on the Microsoft Internet Explorer Test Drive website. It only supports Windows 7; later platform previews only support Windows 8. Internet Explorer 10 Platform Preview 1 supports CSS3 grid layout, CSS3 flexible box layout, CSS3 multi-column layout, CSS3 gradient, and full hardware acceleration. Reviewers' responses to the release of Internet Explorer 10 Platform Preview were varied; however, they noted how soon (29 days) after the release of Internet Explorer 9 Microsoft began talking about the next version. While Don Reisinger of ""eWeek"" listed his requested features for the next version, Michael Muchmore of ""PC Magazine"" tested Platform Preview 1's performance and HTML5 support with both Microsoft's and third-parties' test suites. In his test, Platform Preview 1 performed better than Internet Explorer 9 but not always better than the competing web browsers. On 13 September 2011, Microsoft released the developer preview of Windows 8 to general public, which came with Internet Explorer Developer Preview (the first full browser incarnation of Internet Explorer 10). Although Internet Explorer is the last major web browser – among Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari – to support spell checking, it is the first desktop browser on Windows to support autocorrection. Internet Explorer 10 was released to manufacturing along with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. The latter reached general availability on 4 September 2012 while the former reached general availability on 26 October 2012. A preview of Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 was released on 13 November 2012. It is not compatible with previous versions of Windows. New features. Adobe Flash integration. On Windows 8, Internet Explorer 10 includes a built-in Adobe Flash Player. Microsoft and Adobe worked together to ensure that the version of Adobe Flash included with Internet Explorer 10 does not drain the battery or impact performance in negative ways. In the ""Metro"" version of Internet Explorer, only some of the features of Adobe Flash will be included for battery life, performance and security purposes. Some features that do not work well with touch have also been removed from the ""Metro"" version of Internet Explorer. However, originally, not all websites can use Adobe Flash in the ""Metro"" version of Internet Explorer as Microsoft and Adobe maintain a list of approved websites that are, reportedly, video content and some games. In the desktop version of Internet Explorer 10, all of the features of Adobe Flash are available. On March 12, 2013 Microsoft changed this behavior from allowing only sites on a whitelist to display flash content, to allowing all sites to display flash content except those on a curated Compatibility View (CV) list (blacklist) maintained by Microsoft. User interface. The desktop version of Internet Explorer 10 (available for Windows 7 and Windows 8) retains the user interface (UI) of Internet Explorer 9 with minor refinements, such as removing gradients. The Metro version of Internet Explorer 10 (available on Windows 8) includes a new UI, most of which is hidden so that the webpage being viewed takes up the entire screen. The UI can be revealed by a right click of the mouse or by a swipe from the top or bottom edges of a touchscreen. When the UI is shown, the tabs are listed on the top of the screen, with a small preview of the webpage on each tab. A button to add a new tab is placed in the top-right corner. At the bottom of the screen, the address bar and navigational buttons are shown. Navigational buttons include the Back button (to navigate to the previous page), the Refresh button (to reload active page), the Pin button (which create a new shortcut tile for the active page on the Start screen), and a wrench-shaped icon, which opens the only menu of IE10. It contains options such as ""View on Desktop"", which opens the current webpage on the desktop version of Internet Explorer 10, and ""Find on page"", which can find a text string (a word, phrase or arbitrary set of letters) in the active page. Flip Ahead. Internet Explorer 10 also introduces a new feature called Flip Ahead. This works in both Metro and desktop versions of Internet Explorer 10. It allows users to move through articles that span multiple pages as well as search results and other web pages with a ""next page"" or similar button. This feature is turned off by default as a user's browsing history is sent to Microsoft in order to provide the feature. According to the Windows SuperSite, Microsoft has said that some sites may need to be updated to ensure it will work as intended. Discontinued features. Internet Explorer 10 no longer features or supports the following: Mobile version. At the Windows Phone Developer Summit in June 2012, Joe Belfiore announced Windows Phone 8 due towards the end of 2012, which will include a mobile version of Internet Explorer 10 that offers four times faster JavaScript performance and two times more support for HTML 5 features. It includes Microsoft SmartScreen and supports touch in HTML5 apps. User agent string. Internet Explorer 10 has a new user agent string which has the following general format: Depending on the system, different parts of this user string may change. The last token, ""Touch"", only appears on systems equipped with a touchscreen. The platform token may be any of the following: "
HTTP cookie," HTTP cookie  A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while the user is browsing that website. Every time the user loads the website, the browser sends the cookie back to the server to notify the website of the user's previous activity. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items in a shopping cart) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited by the user as far back as months or years ago). Although cookies cannot carry viruses, and cannot install malware on the host computer, tracking cookies and especially third-party tracking cookies are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories—a potential privacy concern that prompted European and US law makers to take action in 2011. Cookies can also store passwords and forms a user has previously entered, such as a credit card number or an address. When a user accesses a website with a cookie function for the first time, a cookie is sent from server to the browser and stored with the browser in the local computer. Later when that user goes back to the same website, the website will recognize the user because of the stored cookie with the user's information. Other kinds of cookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in under. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's web browser, and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a hacker, used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery for examples). History. The term ""cookie"" was derived from ""magic cookie"", which is the packet of data a program receives and sends again unchanged. Magic cookies were already used in computing when computer programmer Lou Montulli had the idea of using them in web communications in June 1994. At the time, he was an employee of Netscape Communications, which was developing the e-commerce application ""MCI Mall"" for MCI. Vint Cerf and John Klensin represented MCI in technical discussions with Netscape Communications. Not wanting the MCI Mall servers to have to retain partial transaction states led to MCI's request to Netscape to find a way to store that state in each user's computer. Cookies provided a solution to the problem of reliably implementing a virtual shopping cart. Together with John Giannandrea, Montulli wrote the initial Netscape cookie specification the same year. Version 0.9beta of Mosaic Netscape, released on October 13, 1994, supported cookies. The first use of cookies (out of the labs) was checking whether visitors to the Netscape website had already visited the site. Montulli applied for a patent for the cookie technology in 1995, and was granted in 1998. Support for cookies was integrated in Internet Explorer in version 2, released in October 1995. The introduction of cookies was not widely known to the public at the time. In particular, cookies were accepted by default, and users were not notified of the presence of cookies. The general public learned about them after the ""Financial Times"" published an article about them on February 12, 1996. In the same year, cookies received a lot of media attention, especially because of potential privacy implications. Cookies were discussed in two U.S. Federal Trade Commission hearings in 1996 and 1997. The development of the formal cookie specifications was already ongoing. In particular, the first discussions about a formal specification started in April 1995 on the www-talk mailing list. A special working group within the IETF was formed. Two alternative proposals for introducing state in HTTP transactions had been proposed by Brian Behlendorf and David Kristol respectively, but the group, headed by Kristol himself and Aron Afatsuom, soon decided to use the Netscape specification as a starting point. In February 1996, the working group identified third-party cookies as a considerable privacy threat. The specification produced by the group was eventually published as RFC 2109 in February 1997. It specifies that third-party cookies were either not allowed at all, or at least not enabled by default. At this time, advertising companies were already using third-party cookies. The recommendation about third-party cookies of RFC 2109 was not followed by Netscape and Internet Explorer. RFC 2109 was superseded by RFC 2965 in October 2000. A definitive specification for cookies as used in the real world was published as RFC 6265 in April 2011. Terminology. Session cookie. A user's session cookie (also known as an in-memory cookie or transient cookie) for a website exists in temporary memory only while the user is reading and navigating the website. When an expiry date or validity interval is not set at cookie creation time, a session cookie is created. Web browsers normally delete session cookies when the user closes the browser. Persistent cookies. A persistent cookie will outlast user sessions. If a persistent cookie has its Max-Age set to 1 year, then, within the year, the initial value set in that cookie would be sent back to the server every time the user visited the server. This could be used to record a vital piece of information such as how the user initially came to this website. For this reason persistent cookies are also called tracking cookies. Secure cookie. A secure cookie has the secure attribute enabled and is only used via HTTPS, ensuring that the cookie is always encrypted when transmitting from client to server. This makes the cookie less likely to be exposed to cookie theft via eavesdropping. HttpOnly cookie. The HttpOnly attribute is supported by most modern browsers. On a supported browser, an HttpOnly session cookie will be used only when transmitting HTTP (or HTTPS) requests, thus restricting access from other, non-HTTP APIs (such as JavaScript). This restriction mitigates but does not eliminate the threat of session cookie theft via cross-site scripting (XSS). This feature applies only to session-management cookies, and not other browser cookies. Third-party cookie. First-party cookies are cookies that belong to the same domain that is shown in the browser's address bar (or that belong to the sub domain of the domain in the address bar). Third-party cookies are cookies that belong to domains different from the one shown in the address bar. Web pages can feature content from third-party domains (such as banner adverts), which opens up the potential for tracking the user's browsing history. Privacy setting options in most modern browsers allow the blocking of third-party tracking cookies. As an example, suppose a user visits codice_1. This web site contains an advert from codice_2, which, when downloaded, sets a cookie belonging to the advert's domain (codice_2). Then, the user visits another website, codice_4, which also contains an advert from codice_2, and which also sets a cookie belonging to that domain (codice_2). Eventually, both of these cookies will be sent to the advertiser when loading their ads or visiting their website. The advertiser can then use these cookies to build up a browsing history of the user across all the websites this advertiser has footprints on. Supercookie. A ""supercookie"" is a cookie with an origin of a Top-Level Domain (such as codice_7) or a Public Suffix (such as codice_8). It is important that supercookies are blocked by browsers, due to the security holes they introduce. If unblocked, an attacker in control of a malicious website could set a supercookie and potentially disrupt or impersonate legitimate user requests to another website that shares the same Top-Level Domain or Public Suffix as the malicious website. For example, a supercookie with an origin of codice_7, could maliciously affect a request made to codice_10, even if the cookie did not originate from codice_10. This can be used to fake logins or change user information. The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative to provide an accurate list of domain name suffixes changing. Older versions of browsers may not have the most up-to-date list, and will therefore be vulnerable to supercookies from certain domains. Supercookie (other uses). The term ""supercookie"" is sometimes used for tracking technologies that do not rely on HTTP cookies. Two such ""supercookie"" mechanisms were found on Microsoft websites: cookie syncing that respawned MUID cookies, and ETag cookies. Due to media attention, Microsoft later disabled this code: Zombie cookie. Some cookies are automatically recreated after a user has deleted them; these are called ""zombie cookies"". This is accomplished by a script storing the content of the cookie in some other locations, such as the local storage available to Flash content, HTML5 storages and other client side mechanisms, and then recreating the cookie from backup stores when the cookie's absence is detected. Structure. Browsers are expected to support, at least, cookies with a size of 4KB. It consists of six components: The first two components (a name and value) are required to be explicitly set. Uses. Session management. Cookies may be used to maintain data related to the user during navigation, possibly across multiple visits. Cookies were introduced to provide a way to implement a ""shopping cart"" (or ""shopping basket""), a virtual device into which users can store items they want to purchase as they navigate throughout the site. Shopping basket applications today usually store the list of basket contents in a database on the server side, rather than storing basket items in the cookie itself. A web server typically sends a cookie containing a unique session identifier. The web browser will send back that session identifier with each subsequent request and shopping basket items are stored associated with a unique session identifier. Allowing users to log into a website is a frequent use of cookies. Typically the web server will first send a cookie containing a unique session identifier. Users then submit their credentials and the web application authenticates the session and allows the user access to services. Cookies provide a quick and convenient means of client/server interaction. One of the advantages of cookies lies in the fact that they store the user information locally while identifying users simply based on cookie matching. The server's storage and retrieval load is greatly reduced. As a matter of fact, the possibility of applications is endless - any time personal data need to be saved they can be saved as a cookie (Kington, 1997). Personalization. Cookies may be used to remember the information about the user who has visited a website in order to show relevant content in the future. For example a web server might send a cookie containing the username last used to log into a website so that it may be filled in for future visits. Many websites use cookies for personalization based on users' preferences. Users select their preferences by entering them in a web form and submitting the form to the server. The server encodes the preferences in a cookie and sends the cookie back to the browser. This way, every time the user accesses a page, the server is also sent the cookie where the preferences are stored, and can personalize the page according to the user preferences. For example, the Wikipedia website allows authenticated users to choose the webpage skin they like best; the Google search engine once allowed users (even non-registered ones) to decide how many search results per page they want to see. Tracking. Tracking cookies may be used to track internet users' web browsing. This can also be done in part by using the IP address of the computer requesting the page or the referrer field of the HTTP request header, but cookies allow for greater precision. This can be demonstrated as follows: By analyzing the log file collected in the process, it is then possible to find out which pages the user has visited, in what sequence, and for how long. Implementation. Cookies are arbitrary pieces of data chosen by the web server and sent to the browser. The browser returns them unchanged to the server, introducing a state (memory of previous events) into otherwise stateless HTTP transactions. Without cookies, each retrieval of a web page or component of a web page is an isolated event, mostly unrelated to all other views of the pages of the same site. Other than being set by a web server, cookies can also be set by a script in a language such as JavaScript, if supported and enabled by the web browser. Cookie specifications suggest that browsers should be able to save and send back a minimal number of cookies. In particular, a web browser is expected to be able to store at least 300 cookies of four kilobytes each, and at least 20 cookies per server or domain. Setting a cookie. Transfer of Web pages follows the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Regardless of cookies, browsers request a page from web servers by sending them a usually short text called HTTP request. For example, to access the page http://www.example.org/index.html, browsers connect to the server www.example.org sending it a request that looks like the following one: The server replies by sending the requested page preceded by a similar packet of text, called 'HTTP response'. This packet may contain lines requesting the browser to store cookies: The server sends lines of codice_12 only if the server wishes the browser to store cookies. codice_12 is a directive for the browser to store the cookie and send it back in future requests to the server (subject to expiration time or other cookie attributes), if the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled. For example, the browser requests the page http://www.example.org/spec.html by sending the server www.example.org a request like the following: This is a request for another page from the same server, and differs from the first one above because it contains the string that the server has previously sent to the browser. This way, the server knows that this request is related to the previous one. The server answers by sending the requested page, possibly adding other cookies as well. The value of a cookie can be modified by the server by sending a new codice_14 line in response of a page request. The browser then replaces the old value with the new one. The value of a cookie may consist of any printable ascii character (codice_15 through codice_16, unicode codice_17 through codice_18) excluding codice_19 and codice_20 and excluding whitespace. The name of the cookie also excludes codice_21 as that is the delimiter between the name and value. The cookie standard RFC2965 is more limiting but not implemented by browsers. The term ""cookie crumb"" is sometimes used to refer to the name-value pair. This is not the same as breadcrumb web navigation, which is the technique of showing in each page the list of pages the user has previously visited; this technique, however, may be implemented using cookies. Cookies can also be set by JavaScript or similar scripts running within the browser. In JavaScript, the object codice_22 is used for this purpose. For example, the instruction codice_23 creates a cookie of name codice_24 and value codice_25. The HttpOnly attribute prevents unauthorized scripts from reading the cookie. Cookie attributes. Besides the name–value pair, servers can also set these cookie attributes: a cookie domain, a path, expiration time or maximum age, Secure flag and HttpOnly flag. Browsers will not send cookie attributes back to the server. They will only send the cookie’s name-value pair. Cookie attributes are used by browsers to determine when to delete a cookie, block a cookie or whether to send a cookie (name-value pair) to the servers. Domain and Path. The cookie domain and path define the scope of the cookie—they tell the browser that cookies should only be sent back to the server for the given domain and path. If not specified, they default to the domain and path of the object that was requested. An example of Set-Cookie directives from a website after a user logged in: The first cookie codice_26 has default domain codice_27 and Path codice_28, which tells the browser to use the cookie only when requesting pages contained in codice_29. The other 2 cookies codice_30 and codice_31 would be sent back by the browser while requesting any subdomain in codice_32 on any path, for example codice_33. Cookies can only be set on the top domain and its sub domains. Setting cookies on codice_34 from codice_35 will not work for security reasons. Expires and Max-Age. The Expires directive tells the browser when to delete the cookie. Derived from the format used in RFC 1123, the date is specified in the form of “Wdy, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT”, indicating the exact date/time this cookie will expire. As an alternative to setting cookie expiration as an absolute date/time, RFC 6265 allows the use of the Max-Age attribute to set the cookie’s expiration as an interval of seconds in the future, relative to the time the browser received the cookie. An example of Set-Cookie directives from a website after a user logged in: The first cookie codice_36 is set to expire sometime in 15-Jan-2013; it will be used by the client browser until that time. The second cookie codice_37 does not have an expiration date, making it a session cookie. It will be deleted after the user closes their browser. The third cookie codice_38 has its value changed to ""deleted"", with an expiration time in the past. The browser will delete this cookie right away – note that cookie will only be deleted when the domain and path attributes in the codice_12 field match the values used when the cookie was created. Secure and HttpOnly. The Secure and HttpOnly attributes do not have associated values. Rather, the presence of the attribute names indicates that the Secure and HttpOnly behaviors are specified. The Secure attribute is meant to keep cookie communication limited to encrypted transmission, directing browsers to use cookies only via secure/encrypted connections. If a webserver sets a cookie with a secure attribute from a non-secure connection, the cookie can still be intercepted when it is sent to the user by man-in-the-middle attacks. The HttpOnly attribute directs browsers not to expose cookies through channels other than HTTP (and HTTPS) requests. An HttpOnly cookie is not accessible via non-HTTP methods, such as calls via JavaScript (e.g., referencing ""document.cookie""), and therefore cannot be stolen easily via cross-site scripting (a pervasive attack technique). Among others, Facebook and Google use the HttpOnly attribute extensively. Browser settings. Most modern browsers support cookies and allow the user to disable them. The following are common options: Most browsers also allow a full wipe of private data including cookies. Add-on tools for managing cookie permissions also exist. Privacy and third-party cookies. Cookies have some important implications on the privacy and anonymity of web users. While cookies are sent only to the server setting them or a server in the same Internet domain, a web page may contain images or other components stored on servers in other domains. Cookies that are set during retrieval of these components are called ""third-party cookies"". The older standards for cookies, RFC 2109 and RFC 2965, specify that browsers should protect user privacy and not allow sharing of cookies between servers by default; however, the newer standard, RFC 6265, explicitly allows user agents to implement whichever third-party cookie policy they wish. Most browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera and Google Chrome do allow third-party cookies by default, as long as the third-party website has Compact Privacy Policy published. Newer versions of Safari block third-party cookies, and this is planned for Mozilla Firefox as well (almost made it into version 22 but was postponed until further analysis is done). Advertising companies use third-party cookies to track a user across multiple sites. In particular, an advertising company can track a user across all pages where it has placed advertising images or web bugs. Knowledge of the pages visited by a user allows the advertising company to target advertisements to the user's presumed preferences. Website operators who do not disclose third-party cookie use to consumers run the risk of harming consumer trust if cookie use is discovered. Having clear disclosure (such as in a privacy policy) tends to eliminate any negative effects of such cookie discovery. The possibility of building a profile of users is considered by some a potential privacy threat, especially when tracking is done across multiple domains using third-party cookies. For this reason, some countries have legislation about cookies. The United States government has set strict rules on setting cookies in 2000 after it was disclosed that the White House drug policy office used cookies to track computer users viewing its online anti-drug advertising. In 2002, privacy activist Daniel Brandt found that the CIA had been leaving persistent cookies on computers which had visited its website. When notified it was violating policy, CIA stated that these cookies were not intentionally set and stopped setting them. On December 25, 2005, Brandt discovered that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been leaving two persistent cookies on visitors' computers due to a software upgrade. After being informed, the National Security Agency immediately disabled the cookies. EU cookie law. In 2002, the European Union launched the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, a policy requiring end users’ consent for the placement of cookies, and similar technologies for storing and accessing information on users’ equipment. In particular, Article 5 Paragraph 3 mandates that storing data in a user’s computer can only be done if the user is provided information about how this data is used, and the user is given the possibility of denying this storing operation. Directive 95/46/EC defines ‘the data subject’s consent’ as: “any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed”. Consent must involve some form of communication where individuals knowingly indicate their acceptance. In 2009, the policy was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC, which included a change to Article 5 Paragraph 3. Instead of having an option for users to opt out of cookie storage, the revised Directive requires consent to be obtained for cookie storage. In June 2012, European data protection authorities adopted an opinion which clarifies that some cookie users might be exempt from the requirement to gain consent: The industry’s response has been largely negative. Some viewed the Directive as an infernal doomsday machine that will ""kill online sales"" and ""kill the internet"". Robert Bond of the law firm Speechly Bircham describes the effects as ""far-reaching and incredibly onerous"" for ""all UK companies."" Simon Davis of Privacy International argues that proper enforcement would ""destroy the entire industry."" The P3P specification offers possibility for a server to state a privacy policy using an HTTP header, which specifies which kind of information it collects and for which purpose. These policies include (but are not limited to) the use of information gathered using cookies. According to the P3P specification, a browser can accept or reject cookies by comparing the privacy policy with the stored user preferences or ask the user, presenting them the privacy policy as declared by the server. However, the P3P specification was criticized by web developers for its complexity, only Internet Explorer provides adequate support for the specification, and some websites used incorrect code in their headers (while Facebook, for a period, jokingly used ""HONK"" as its P3P header). Third-party cookies can be blocked by most browsers to increase privacy and reduce tracking by advertising and tracking companies without negatively affecting the user's web experience. Many advertising operators have an opt-out option to behavioural advertising, with a generic cookie in the browser stopping behavioural advertising. Cookie theft and session hijacking. Most websites use cookies as the only identifiers for user sessions, because other methods of identifying web users have limitations and vulnerabilities. If a website uses cookies as session identifiers, attackers can impersonate users’ requests by stealing a full set of victims’ cookies. From the web server's point of view, a request from an attacker then has the same authentication as the victim’s requests; thus the request is performed on behalf of the victim’s session. Listed here are various scenarios of cookie theft and user session hijacking (even without stealing user cookies) which work with websites which rely solely on HTTP cookies for user identification. Network eavesdropping. Traffic on a network can be intercepted and read by computers on the network other than the sender and receiver (particularly over unencrypted open Wi-Fi). This traffic includes cookies sent on ordinary unencrypted HTTP sessions. Where network traffic is not encrypted, attackers can therefore read the communications of other users on the network, including HTTP cookies as well as the entire contents of the conversations, for the purpose of a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker could use intercepted cookies to impersonate a user and perform a malicious task, such as transferring money out of the victim’s bank account. This issue can be resolved by securing the communication between the user's computer and the server by employing Transport Layer Security (HTTPS protocol) to encrypt the connection. A server can specify the ""Secure"" flag while setting a cookie, which will cause the browser to send the cookie only over an encrypted channel, such as an SSL connection. Publishing false sub-domain – DNS cache poisoning. Via DNS cache poisoning, an attacker might be able to cause a DNS server to cache a fabricated DNS entry, say codice_40 with the attacker’s server IP address. The attacker can then post an image URL from his own server (for example, codice_41). Victims reading the attacker’s message would download this image from codice_40. Since codice_40 is a sub-domain of codice_44, victims’ browsers would submit all codice_10-related cookies to the attacker’s server; the compromised cookies would also include ""HttpOnly"" cookies. This vulnerability is usually for Internet Service Providers to fix, by securing their DNS servers. But it can also be mitigated if codice_44 is using ""Secure"" cookies. Victims’ browsers will not submit ""Secure"" cookies if the attacker’s image is not using encrypted connections. If the attacker chose to use HTTPS for his img_4_cookie.jpg download, he would have the challenge of obtaining an SSL certificate for codice_40 from a Certificate Authority. Without a proper SSL certificate, victims’ browsers would display (usually very visible) warning messages about the invalid certificate, thus alerting victims as well as security officials from codice_44 (the latter would require someone to inform the security officials). Cross-site scripting – cookie theft. Scripting languages such as JavaScript are usually allowed to access cookie values and have some means to send arbitrary values to arbitrary servers on the Internet. These facts are used in combination with sites allowing users to post HTML content that other users can see. As an example, an attacker may post a message on codice_44 with the following link: When another user clicks on this link, the browser executes the piece of code within the codice_50 attribute, thus replacing the string codice_22 with the list of cookies of the user that are active for the page. As a result, this list of cookies is sent to the codice_52 server. If the attacker’s posting is on codice_53, secure cookies will also be sent to attacker.com in plain text. Cross-site scripting is a constant threat, as there are always some crackers trying to find a way of slipping in script tags to websites. It is the responsibility of the website developers to filter out such malicious code. In the meantime, such attacks can be mitigated by using ""HttpOnly"" cookies. These cookies will not be accessible by client side script, and therefore, the attacker will not be able to gather these cookies. Cross-site scripting. If an attacker was able to insert a piece of script to a page on codice_44, and a victim’s browser was able to execute the script, the script could simply carry out the attack. This attack would use the victim’s browser to send HTTP requests to servers directly; therefore, the victim’s browser would submit all relevant cookies, including ""HttpOnly"" cookies, as well as ""Secure"" cookies if the script request is on HTTPS. This type of attack (with automated scripts) would not work if a website had CAPTCHA to challenge client requests. Cross-site scripting – proxy request. In older versions of browsers, there were security holes allowing attackers to script a proxy request by using XMLHttpRequest. For example, a victim is reading an attacker’s posting on codice_44, and the attacker’s script is executed in the victim’s browser. The script generates a request to codice_44 with the proxy server codice_52. Since the request is for codice_44, all codice_10 cookies will be sent along with the request, but routed through the attacker’s proxy server, hence, the attacker can harvest the victim’s cookies. This attack would not work for ""Secure"" cookie, since ""Secure"" cookies go with HTTPS connections, and its protocol dictates end-to-end encryption, i.e., the information is encrypted on the user’s browser and decrypted on the destination server codice_44, so the proxy servers would only see encrypted bits and bytes. Cross-site request forgery. For example, Bob might be browsing a chat forum where another user, Mallory, has posted a message. Suppose that Mallory has crafted an HTML image element that references an action on Bob's bank's website (rather than an image file), e.g., If Bob's bank keeps his authentication information in a cookie, and if the cookie hasn't expired, then the attempt by Bob's browser to load the image will submit the withdrawal form with his cookie, thus authorizing a transaction without Bob's approval. Drawbacks of cookies. Besides privacy concerns, cookies also have some technical drawbacks. In particular, they do not always accurately identify users, they can be used for security attacks, and they are often at odds with the Representational State Transfer (REST) software architectural style. For example, investopedia site installs up to 20 cookies to track the user's behavior. Inaccurate identification. If more than one browser is used on a computer, each usually has a separate storage area for cookies. Hence cookies do not identify a person, but a combination of a user account, a computer, and a web browser. Thus, anyone who uses multiple accounts, computers, or browsers has multiple sets of cookies. Likewise, cookies do not differentiate between multiple users who share the same user account, computer, and browser. Inconsistent state on client and server. The use of cookies may generate an inconsistency between the state of the client and the state as stored in the cookie. If the user acquires a cookie and then clicks the ""Back"" button of the browser, the state on the browser is generally not the same as before that acquisition. As an example, if the shopping cart of an online shop is built using cookies, the content of the cart may not change when the user goes back in the browser's history: if the user presses a button to add an item in the shopping cart and then clicks on the ""Back"" button, the item remains in the shopping cart. This might not be the intention of the user, who possibly wanted to undo the addition of the item. This can lead to unreliability, confusion, and bugs. Web developers should therefore be aware of this issue and implement measures to handle such situations. Inconsistent support by devices. The problem with using mobile cookies is that most devices do not implement cookies; for example, Nokia only supports cookies on 60% of its devices, while Motorola only supports cookies on 45% of its phones. In addition, some gateways and networks (Verizon, Alltel, and MetroPCS) strip cookies, while other networks simulate cookies on behalf of their mobile devices. There are also dramatic variations in the wireless markets around the world; for example, in the United Kingdom 94% of the devices support wireless cookies, while in the United States only 47% support them. The support for cookies is greater in the Far East, where wireless devices are more commonly used to access the web. Mobile cookies is a practice already in place in Japan, so that whether watching a podcast, a video, TV, clicking on a loan calculator or a GPS map—on almost all wireless devices—cookies can be set for tracking and capturing wireless behaviors. Alternatives to cookies. Some of the operations that can be done using cookies can also be done using other mechanisms. IP address. Some users may be tracked based on the IP address of the computer requesting the page. The server knows the IP address of the computer running the browser or the proxy, if any is used, and could theoretically link a user's session to this IP address. IP addresses are, generally, not a reliable way to track a session or identify a user. Many computers designed to be used by a single user, such as office PCs or home PCs, are behind a network address translator (NAT). This means that several PCs will share a public IP address. Furthermore, some systems, such as Tor, are designed to retain Internet anonymity, rendering tracking by IP address impractical, impossible, or a security risk. URL (query string). A more precise technique is based on embedding information into URLs. The query string part of the URL is the one that is typically used for this purpose, but other parts can be used as well. The Java Servlet and PHP session mechanisms both use this method if cookies are not enabled. This method consists of the web server appending query strings to the links of a web page it holds when sending it to a browser. When the user follows a link, the browser returns the attached query string to the server. Query strings used in this way and cookies are very similar, both being arbitrary pieces of information chosen by the server and sent back by the browser. However, there are some differences: since a query string is part of a URL, if that URL is later reused, the same attached piece of information is sent to the server. For example, if the preferences of a user are encoded in the query string of a URL and the user sends this URL to another user by e-mail, those preferences will be used for that other user as well. Moreover, even if the same user accesses the same page two times, there is no guarantee that the same query string is used in both views. For example, if the same user arrives to the same page but coming from a page internal to the site the first time and from an external search engine the second time, the relative query strings are typically different while the cookies would be the same. For more details, see query string. Other drawbacks of query strings are related to security: storing data that identifies a session in a query string enables or simplifies session fixation attacks, referrer logging attacks and other security exploits. Transferring session identifiers as HTTP cookies is more secure. Hidden form fields. Another form of session tracking is to use web forms with hidden fields. This technique is very similar to using URL query strings to hold the information and has many of the same advantages and drawbacks; and if the form is handled with the HTTP GET method, the fields actually become part of the URL the browser will send upon form submission. But most forms are handled with HTTP POST, which causes the form information, including the hidden fields, to be appended as extra input that is neither part of the URL, nor of a cookie. This approach presents two advantages from the point of view of the tracker: first, having the tracking information placed in the HTML source and POST input rather than in the URL means it will not be noticed by the average user; second, the session information is not copied when the user copies the URL (to save the page on disk or send it via email, for example). This method can be easily used with any framework that supports web forms. window.name. All current web browsers can store a fairly large amount of data (2–32 MB) via JavaScript using the DOM property window.name. This data can be used instead of session cookies and is also cross-domain. The technique can be coupled with JSON/JavaScript objects to store complex sets of session variables on the client side. The downside is that every separate window or tab will initially have an empty ""window.name""; in times of tabbed browsing this means that individually opened tabs ""(initiation by user)"" will not have a window name. Furthermore ""window.name"" can be used for tracking visitors across different websites, making it of concern for Internet privacy. In some respects this can be more secure than cookies due to not involving the server, so it is not vulnerable to ""network"" cookie sniffing attacks. However if special measures are not taken to protect the data, it is vulnerable to other attacks because the data is available across different websites opened in the same window or tab. HTTP authentication. The HTTP protocol includes the basic access authentication and the digest access authentication protocols, which allow access to a web page only when the user has provided the correct username and password. If the server requires such credentials for granting access to a web page, the browser requests them from the user and, once obtained, the browser stores and sends them in every subsequent page request. This information can be used to track the user. "
Google Search," Google Search Appliance  The Google Search Appliance is a rack-mounted device providing document indexing functionality that can be integrated into an intranet, document management system or web site using a Google Search-like interface for end-user retrieval of results. The operating system is based on CentOS. The software is produced by Google and the hardware is manufactured by Dell and is based on Dell's PowerEdge R710. The device is supplied in two models: a 2U model (GB-7007) capable of indexing up to 10 million documents, and a 5U (2U plus 3U storage) model (GB-9009) that is capable of indexing up to 30 million documents. Later versions of the software allow the connecting of multiple appliances to offer searching ""millions or billions"" of documents. Sales are operated on a licensing scheme which starts as a two-year contract for maintenance, support and software updates. Features. The Google Search Appliance contains Google search technologies and a means of configuring and customizing the appliance. The appliance also comes with a T-shirt. Other features include Administration. Minimal support infrastructure and sysadmin staff is needed as quoted on their web site “…doesn’t need a tech support baby-sitter. You simply plug it in, configure it, and let it run…”. The device does come with a web based administrative console that can be used to make configuration changes where needed. Additional customisation is possible through a Representational State Transfer (REST) API that allows for automation of tasks. There are also existing modules that can be used for customization. Newest software. Software version 6.0 was released in June, 2009. This software runs on some hardware versions of the GB-1001 model (all units with an ""S5"" prefix in their ""Appliance ID""), and all GB-7007 and GB-9009 models. New features available in this software include: Models. The Google Search Appliance can be purchased in two separate versions based on the number of documents being indexed. Model G100, a 2U appliance, can index up to 20,000,000 documents. The G500 5U appliance can index up to 100,000,000 documents. Implementation. In 2008, product brokerage and internet marketing company Market America implemented Google Search Appliance. However, this was short-lived. In 2009 Microsoft's Fast ESP was selected due to its more powerful indexing capability. Discontinued versions. Older appliances. Google used to sell a 1U appliance (GB-1001) capable of indexing up to 5,000,000 documents, a half-rack cluster (GB-5005) of five 2U nodes capable of indexing up to 10,000,000 documents, and a full-rack cluster (GB-8008) of eight and later twelve nodes capable of indexing up to 30,000,000 documents. Some models were based on Dell PowerEdge 2950 2U rackmount servers. Google Mini. The Google Mini was a smaller and lower-cost solution for small and medium-sized businesses to set up a search engine that allowed them to index and search up to 300,000 documents. As part of Google's spring cleaning 2012 the Google Mini was discontinued beginning July 31, 2012. Google Search Appliance virtual edition for developers. For a brief period in 2008 Google offered a virtual version of the Google Search Appliance aimed at developers. The virtual edition could be downloaded free of charge and index up to 50,000 documents. It was soon discontinued for unknown reasons. Product availability. The Google Search Appliance is available in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, parts of Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and South America.  If a person is interested in using the Google Search Appliance in another region, they can deploy the Google Search Appliance at a location or data center in the US, Canada, or Europe. Criticism. Even though Google search and Google Search Appliances have proven to have many advantages for organizations implementing them, some business analysts have suggested that Google Search Appliances may introduce two risks: for breaching the privacy acts, and for exposing the organization to commercial security risks. "
Tumblr," Tumblr  Tumblr, stylized in its logo as tumblr., is a microblogging platform and social networking website founded by David Karp and owned by Yahoo! Inc. The service allows users to post multimedia and other content to a short-form blog. Users can follow other users' blogs, as well as make their blogs private. Much of the website's features are accessed from the ""dashboard"" interface, where the option to post content and posts of followed blogs appear. As of October 1, 2013, Tumblr hosts over 139.4 million blogs. Its headquarters is at 35 East 21st Street in the Flatiron District in New York City's Silicon Alley.  Yahoo! announced its intention to acquire Tumblr on May 20, 2013, for approximately $1.1 billion. The deal closed on June 20, 2013. History. Development of Tumblr began in 2006 during a two-week gap between contracts at David Karp's software consulting company, Davidville (housed at Karp's former internship with producer/incubator Fred Seibert's Frederator Studios which was located a block from Tumblr's current headquarters). Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and developer Marco Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform. Tumblr was launched in February 2007 and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users. Arment left the company in September 2010 to focus on Instapaper. In early June 2012, Tumblr featured its first major brand advertising campaign in conjunction with Adidas. Adidas launched an official soccer Tumblr blog and bought placements on the user dashboard. This launch was only two months after Tumblr announced it would be moving towards paid advertising on its site. On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion in cash. Many of Tumblr's users were unhappy with the news, causing some to start a petition, achieving nearly 170,000 signatures. David Karp will remain CEO and the deal was finalized on June 20, 2013. Features. Mobile. With Tumblr's 2009 acquisition of Tumblerette, an Apple App Store application created by Jeff Rock and Garrett Ross, the service launched its official iPhone app. The site became available to BlackBerry smartphones on April 17, 2010 via a Mobelux application in BlackBerry World. In June 2012, Tumblr released a new version of its iOS app, Tumblr 3.0 allowing support for Spotify, hi-res images and offline access. An app for Android is also available. A Windows Phone app was released on April 23, 2013. An app for Google Glass was released on May 16, 2013. Editorial content. In May 2012, Tumblr launched Storyboard, a blog managed by an in-house editorial team which features stories and videos about noteworthy blogs and users on Tumblr. In April 2013, Storyboard was shut down. Usage. An analysis by AddThis of shares through their service in 2011 noted that Tumblr sharing had increased by 1299.5%. The service is most popular with the teen and college-aged user segments with half of Tumblr's visitor base being under the age of 25.  It has been noted that Tumblr is popular with the female demographic, with 53.5% of visitors being female as of 2011. 17% of Tumblr users are Hispanic, compared to 9% of US internet users who are Hispanic. 10% are African American, which is slightly higher than on the internet in general. Adult content. Tumblr is noted by technology journalists as having a sizable amount of pornographic content, though the exact amount is known only to the company. ""The New York Times"" notes ""pornography represents a fraction of content on the site, but not a trivial amount for a site with 100 million blogs."" Karp revealed in June 2012 that between 2 and 4 percent of Tumblr's traffic is porn-related. Tumblr's Community Guidelines permits adult-oriented content but requires that blogs that contain occasional or substantial mature content to be flagged as such. Sexually-explicit videos are not allowed to be uploaded to the website, but videos hosted elsewhere may be embedded. Some porn bloggers earn money by referring traffic to adult businesses through referrals and widgets. As of July 20, 2013, policy updates enacted by Tumblr mean that pages classified as ""NSFW"" or ""adult"" will not feature in tag pages for users who are not logged in or who have the ""Safe Mode"" activated. For users who are logged in to Tumblr, but do not have ""Safe Mode"" turned on, NSFW blogs should show up on search and tag pages; however, blogs deemed ""adult,"" are not indexed by third-party search engines or by Tumblr's own search function. In a public statement, the company conveyed the following: Tumblr's longstanding policy regarding NSFW content has not changed and emphasizes the importance of free expression. As addressed in these policies, we are constantly taking measures to ensure our users can avoid this content unless they'd like to see it. Anyone can opt-in by disabling Safe Mode in their Dashboard Settings. Finances. Funding. To date, Tumblr has received about $125 million of funding from investors. The company has raised funding from Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, Martín Varsavsky, John Borthwick (Betaworks), Krum Capital, Fred Seibert, and Sequoia Capital (among other investors). In its first round of funding in October 2007, Tumblr raised $750,000 from Spark Capital and Union Square Ventures. In December 2008, the company raised $4.5 million in Series B funding and a further $5 million in April 2010. In December 2010, Tumblr raised $30 million in Series D funding. The company had a $800 million valuation in August 2011. In September 2011, the company raised $85 million in a round of funding led by Greylock Partners and Insight Venture Partners. Revenue sources. In an interview with Nicole Lapin of ""Bloomberg West"" on September 7, 2012, David Karp said the site was monetized by advertising, and he argued that with the high number of users of the service, advertisers would start to look seriously spending money there. Their first advertising launch started in May 2012 after 16 experimental campaigns. Tumblr made $13 million in revenue in 2012 and hopes to make $100 million in 2013. Tumblr reportedly spent $25 million to fund operations in 2012. During the first half of 2013, Tumblr will allow companies to pay to promote their own posts to a larger audience. Tumblr Head of Sales, Lee Brown, states that the average ad purchase on Tumblr is just under six figures. Brown also states that this functionality will lead Tumblr to profitability in 2013. Tumblr also generates revenue by selling themes to users to change the appearance of their blog. Criticism. Copyright violation. Tumblr has received criticism for the ability of bloggers to violate copyright. However, Tumblr does accept Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notices. Tumblr's visual appeal has made it ideal for photoblogs, which often include copyrighted works from others and publishing them without payment. Tumblr users are able to post content that isn't their own by ""Reblogging"". ""Reblogging"" is a feature on Tumblr which allows users to re-post content that they found on a blog which they subscribe to, onto their own blog. Security. Tumblr has had spam and security problems as well. In May 2011 the site experienced a chain letter scam that claimed 130,000 victims. On December 3, 2012, Tumblr was attacked by a cross-site scripting worm deployed by the Internet troll group Gay Nigger Association of America. The message encouraged users to harm themselves as well as criticizing blogging as a whole. "
Hypertext Transfer Protocol," Hypertext Transfer Protocol  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext. The standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs), most notably RFC 2616 (June 1999), which defines HTTP/1.1, the version of HTTP in common use. Technical overview. HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. A web browser, for example, may be the ""client"" and an application running on a computer hosting a web site may be the ""server"". The client submits an HTTP ""request"" message to the server. The server, which provides ""resources"" such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a ""response"" message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body. A web browser is an example of a ""user agent"" (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps and other software that accesses, consumes or displays web content. HTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them when possible to reduce network traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed within the framework of the Internet Protocol Suite. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable transport layer protocol, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is commonly used. However HTTP can use unreliable protocols such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for example in Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). HTTP resources are identified and located on the network by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)—or, more specifically, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)—using the http or https URI schemes. URIs and hyperlinks in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents form ""webs"" of inter-linked hypertext documents.  HTTP/1.1 is a revision of the original HTTP (HTTP/1.0). In HTTP/1.0 a separate connection to the same server is made for every resource request. HTTP/1.1 can reuse a connection multiple times to download images, scripts, stylesheets ""et cetera"" after the page has been delivered. HTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less latency as the establishment of TCP connections presents considerable overhead. History. The term HyperText was coined by Ted Nelson who in turn was inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based ""memex"". Tim Berners-Lee first proposed the ""WorldWideWeb"" project — now known as the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee and his team are credited with inventing the original HTTP along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a text-based web browser. The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page. The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9 (1991). Dave Raggett led the HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG) in 1995 and wanted to expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields. RFC 1945 officially introduced and recognized HTTP V1.0 in 1996. The HTTP WG planned to publish new standards in December 1995 and the support for pre-standard HTTP/1.1 based on the then developing RFC 2068 (called HTTP-NG) was rapidly adopted by the major browser developers in early 1996. By March 1996, pre-standard HTTP/1.1 was supported in Arena, Netscape 2.0, Netscape Navigator Gold 2.01, Mosaic 2.7, Lynx 2.5, and in Internet Explorer 2.0. End-user adoption of the new browsers was rapid. In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of browsers in use on the Internet were HTTP 1.1 compliant. That same web hosting company reported that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers accessing their servers were HTTP/1.1 compliant. The HTTP/1.1 standard as defined in RFC 2068 was officially released in January 1997. Improvements and updates to the HTTP/1.1 standard were released under RFC 2616 in June 1999. HTTP session. An HTTP session is a sequence of network request-response transactions. An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to a particular port on a server (typically port 80; see List of TCP and UDP port numbers). An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as ""HTTP/1.1 200 OK"", and a message of its own. The body of this message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned. Request methods. HTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as ""verbs"") to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification defined the GET, POST and HEAD methods and the HTTP/1.1 specification added 5 new methods: OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT. By being specified in these documents their semantics are well known and can be depended upon. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate it will be treated as an unsafe and non-idempotent method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined and this allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example WebDAV defined 7 new methods and RFC5789 specified the PATCH method. HTTP servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods and, whenever possible, also the OPTIONS method. Safe methods. Some methods (for example, HEAD, GET, OPTIONS and TRACE) are defined as ""safe"", which means they are intended only for information retrieval and should not change the state of the server. In other words, they should not have side effects, beyond relatively harmless effects such as logging, caching, the serving of banner advertisements or incrementing a web counter. Making arbitrary GET requests without regard to the context of the application's state should therefore be considered safe. By contrast, methods such as POST, PUT and DELETE are intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as financial transactions or transmission of email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences. Despite the prescribed safety of ""GET"" requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Therefore, careless or deliberate programming can cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged, because it can cause problems for Web caching, search engines and other automated agents, which can make unintended changes on the server. Idempotent methods and web applications. Methods PUT and DELETE are defined to be idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request (Note that idempotence refers to the state of the system after the request has completed, so while the action the server takes (e.g. deleting a record) or the response code it returns may be different on subsequent requests, the system state will be the same every time). Methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, being prescribed as safe, should also be idempotent, as HTTP is a stateless protocol. In contrast, the POST method is not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects (such as financial transactions). In some cases this may be desirable, but in other cases this could be due to an accident, such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request, or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once. Note that whether a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. Ignoring this recommendation, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it isn't. Security. Implementing methods such as TRACE, TRACK and DEBUG is considered potentially insecure by some security professionals because attackers can use them to gather information or bypass security controls during attacks. Security software tools such as Tenable Nessus and Microsoft UrlScan Security Tool report on the presence of these methods as being security issues. TRACK and DEBUG are not valid HTTP 1.1 verbs in any event. Status codes. In HTTP/1.0 and since, the first line of the HTTP response is called the ""status line"" and includes a numeric ""status code"" (such as ""404"") and a textual ""reason phrase"" (such as ""Not Found""). The way the user agent handles the response primarily depends on the code and secondarily on the response headers. Custom status codes can be used since, if the user agent encounters a code it does not recognize, it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response. Also, the standard ""reason phrases"" are only recommendations and can be replaced with ""local equivalents"" at the web developer's discretion. If the status code indicated a problem, the user agent might display the ""reason phrase"" to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the ""reason phrase"", though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and ""reason phrases"" are human-readable. Persistent connections. In HTTP/0.9 and 1.0, the connection is closed after a single request/response pair. In HTTP/1.1 a keep-alive-mechanism was introduced, where a connection could be reused for more than one request. Such ""persistent connections"" reduce request latency perceptibly, because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that in general the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP's slow-start-mechanism. Version 1.1 of the protocol also made bandwidth optimization improvements to HTTP/1.0. For example, HTTP/1.1 introduced chunked transfer encoding to allow content on persistent connections to be streamed rather than buffered. HTTP pipelining further reduces lag time, allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response. Another improvement to the protocol was byte serving, where a server transmits just the portion of a resource explicitly requested by a client. HTTP session state. HTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol does not require the HTTP server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. However, some web applications implement states or server side sessions using one or more of the following methods: Encrypted connections. The most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTP Secure. Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist, called Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol and the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header. Browser support, for these latter two, is, however, nearly non-existent, so HTTP Secure is the dominant method of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection. Request message. The request message consists of the following: The request line and headers must all end with  (that is, a carriage return character followed by a line feed character). The empty line must consist of only  and no other whitespace. In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all headers except Host are optional. A request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP/1.0 specification in RFC 1945. Response message. The response message consists of the following: The Status-Line and headers must all end with  (a carriage return followed by a line feed). The empty line must consist of only  and no other whitespace. Example session. Below is a sample conversation between an HTTP client and an HTTP server running on www.example.com, port 80. Client request. A client request (consisting in this case of the request line and only one header) is followed by a blank line, so that the request ends with a double newline, each in the form of a carriage return followed by a line feed. The ""Host"" header distinguishes between various DNS names sharing a single IP address, allowing name-based virtual hosting. While optional in HTTP/1.0, it is mandatory in HTTP/1.1. Server response. The ETag (entity tag) header is used to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server. ""Content-Type"" specifies the Internet media type of the data conveyed by the HTTP message, while ""Content-Length"" indicates its length in bytes. The HTTP/1.1 webserver publishes its ability to respond to requests for certain byte ranges of the document by setting the header ""Accept-Ranges: bytes"". This is useful, if the client needs to have only certain portions of a resource sent by the server, which is called byte serving. When ""Connection: close"" is sent in a header, it means that the web server will close the TCP connection immediately after the transfer of this response. Most of the header lines are optional. When ""Content-Length"" is missing the length is determined in other ways. Chunked transfer encoding uses a chunk size of 0 to mark the end of the content. ""Identity"" encoding without ""Content-Length"" reads content until the socket is closed. A ""Content-Encoding"" like ""gzip"" can be used to compress the transmitted data. Alternatives to HTTP. Historically, Gopher existed as a competitor to HTTP. "
Social search," Social search  Social search or a social search engine is a type of web search that takes into account the Social Graph of the person initiating the search query. When applied to web search this Social-Graph approach to relevance is in contrast to established algorithmic or machine-based approaches where relevance is determined by analyzing the text of each document or the link structure of the documents. Search results produced by social search engine give more visibility to content created or ""touched"" by users in the Social Graph. Social search takes many forms, ranging from simple shared bookmarks or tagging of content with descriptive labels to more sophisticated approaches that combine human intelligence with computer algorithms. The search experience takes into account varying sources of metadata, such as collaborative discovery of web pages, tags, social ranking, commenting on bookmarks, news, images, videos, knowledge sharing, podcasts and other web pages. Example forms of user input include social bookmarking or direct interaction with the search results such as promoting or demoting results the user feels are more or less relevant to their query. History. The term social search began to emerge between 2004 and 2005. The concept of social ranking can be considered to derive from Google's PageRank algorithm, which assigns importance to web pages based on analysis of the link structure of the web, because PageRank is relying on the collective judgment of webmasters linking to other content on the web. Links, in essence, are positive votes by the webmaster community for their favorite sites. In 2008, there were a few startup companies that focused on ranking search results according to one's social graph on social networks. Companies in the social search space include HeyStaks, Evam-SOCOTO Wajam, folkd, Slangwho, Sproose, Mahalo, Jumper 2.0, Qitera, Scour, Wink, Eurekster, Baynote, Delver, OneRiot, SideStripe and ABCtribe.com Answer. Former efforts include Wikia Search. In 2008, a story on ""TechCrunch"" showed Google potentially adding in a voting mechanism to search results similar to Digg's methodology. This suggests growing interest in how social groups can influence and potentially enhance the ability of algorithms to find meaningful data for end users. There are also other services like Sentiment that turn search personal by searching within the users' social circles. The term 'Lazyweb' has been used to describe the act of out-sourcing your questions to your friends, usually by broadcasting them on Twitter or Facebook (as opposed to posting them on Q&A websites such as Yahoo Answers). The company Aardvark, acquired by Google in February 2010, has created a more targeted version of this, which directs your questions to people in your social networks, based on relating the content of the question to the content of their social network pages. Aardvark users primarily use the Aardvark IM buddy, also integrated into Google Gmail, to ask and answer their questions. The company Cofacio released a beta platform in August 2009 in the UK which marks a return to the open, broadcast method of social search for the Twitter/Facebook generation. In October 2009, Google rolled out its ""Social Search"" feature; after a time in beta, the feature was expanded to multiple languages in May 2011. However, after a search deal with Twitter ended without renewal, Google began to retool its Social Search. In January 2012, Google released ""Search plus Your World"", a further development of Social Search. The feature, which is integrated into Google's regular search as an opt-out feature, pulls references to results from Google+ profiles. The company was subsequently criticized by Twitter for the perceived potential impact of ""Search plus Your World"" upon web publishers, describing the feature's release to the public as a ""bad day for the web"", while Google replied that Twitter refused to allow deep search crawling by Google of Twitter's content. Benefits. To date social search engines have not demonstrated measurably improved search results over algorithmic search engines. However, there are potential benefits deriving from the human input qualities of social search. "
Firefox," Firefox 3.6  Mozilla Firefox 3.6 was a version of the Firefox web browser released in January 2010. The release's main improvement over Firefox 3.5 is improved performance (due to further speed improvements in the TraceMonkey JavaScript engine). It uses the Gecko 1.9.2 engine (compared to 1.9.1 in FF 3.5), which improves compliance with web standards. It was codenamed ""Namoroka"". In this version, support for X BitMap images was dropped. This release marked the beginning of a new development cycle for Firefox. As well as receiving major updates, the browser also received minor updates with new features. This was to allow users to receive new features more quickly and the dawn of a new roadmap that reflected these changes. It was superseded by Firefox 4, released the next year, although FF 3.6 had a prolonged period of use and version 4 had noted user interface changes. Firefox 3.6 is the last major version of an official Firefox release to run on PowerPC-based Macintoshes (please see TenFourFox for a much-more-recent version of Firefox for PowerPC-based computers running Mac OS X). Soon after 4, much less weight was given to major version numbers, with 6 numbers used by September of that year (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) compared to 3 in nearly a decade of Firefox development (1,2 and 3). Firefox versions 4 through 9 had all reached end-of-life status while Mozilla continued supporting Firefox 3.6 with security updates. Coinciding with a proposal to cater to Enterprise users with optional Extended Support Releases beginning in 2012 based upon Firefox 10, Mozilla discontinued support for Firefox 3.6 on April 24, 2012 with automatic update to Firefox 12 pushed out to compatible devices by June 2012. Development. Development for this version started on December 1, 2008. The first alpha of version 3.6 was released on August 7, 2009. The first beta version was released on October 30, followed by Beta 2 on November 10, Beta 3 on November 17, Beta 4 on November 26, and Beta 5 on December 17. Release Candidate 1 was released on January 8, 2010, followed by Release Candidate 2 on January 17. The final version was released on January 21, 2010. Minor releases. Firefox 3.6.2 was released on March 23, 2010, followed by version 3.6.3 on April 1 which closed some bugs in the ASLR and DEP handling found at the Pwn2Own contest 2010. The Firefox developers created a new feature called ""Lorentz"". It is named after the Lorentz National Park. A preview version of Lorentz, Firefox 3.6.3plugin1, was made available on April 8, 2010. Betas of Firefox 3.6.4 were made available starting on April 20, 2010. Firefox 3.6.4 was released on June 22, 2010. The Windows and Linux versions incorporate out-of-process plug-ins (OOPP), which isolates execution of plug-ins (Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime and Microsoft Silverlight by default) into a separate process. This significantly reduces the number of Firefox crashes experienced by users who are watching online videos or playing games; the user can simply refresh the page to continue. Mozilla states that 30% of browser crashes are caused by third-party plugins. Support for other plug-ins by default in OOPP and on the Mac OS X platform will become available in Firefox 4. Firefox 3.6.6 lengthens the amount of time a plug-in is allowed to be unresponsive to the point before the plug-in quits. Firefox 3.6.7 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.8 was a security update that was released a mere three days after 3.6.7, to fix another security fault. Firefox 3.6.9, in addition to fixing security and stability issues, introduced support for the codice_1 HTTP response header to help prevent clickjacking. Firefox 3.6.10 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.11 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.12 was a security update that fixed a critical security issue. Firefox 3.6.13 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.14 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.15 was a stability update that fixed a Java applets issue. Firefox 3.6.16 was a security update that blacklisted a few invalid HTTPS certificates. Firefox 3.6.17 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.18 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.19 was a stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.20 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.21 was a security update that blacklisted a compromised HTTPS certificate. Firefox 3.6.22 was a security update that revoked the SSL certificates for ""Staten der Nederlanden"" due to fraudulent SSL certificate issuance, as well as fixing an error with .gov.uk domain names. Firefox 3.6.23 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.24 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.25 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.26 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.27 was a security update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.28 is a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Features. New features for Firefox 3.6 include End of Life. Mozilla discontinued support for Firefox 3.6 on April 24, 2012, which at over 27 months of support made it the longest supported version of Firefox, even longer than Firefox 2 which had over 26 months of total support itself. The underlying Gecko 1.9.2 engine continued to be used, with updates, in Camino. "
LinkedIn," LinkedIn  LinkedIn is a social networking website for people in professional occupations. Founded in December 2002 and launched on May 5, 2003, it is mainly used for professional networking. , LinkedIn reports more than 225 million acquired users in more than 200 countries and territories. The site is available in 20 languages, including English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Romanian, Russian, Turkish, Japanese, Czech, Polish, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, and Tagalog. , Quantcast reports LinkedIn has 65.6 million monthly unique U.S. visitors and 178.4 million globally. In June 2011, LinkedIn had 33.9 million unique visitors, up 63 percent from a year earlier and surpassing MySpace. LinkedIn filed for an initial public offering in January 2011 and traded its first shares on May 19, 2011, under the NYSE symbol ""LNKD"". History. LinkedIn's CEO is Jeff Weiner, previously a Yahoo! Inc. executive. The company was founded by Reid Hoffman and founding team members from PayPal and Socialnet.com (Allen Blue, Eric Ly, Jean-Luc Vaillant, Lee Hower, Konstantin Guericke, Stephen Beitzel, David Eves, Ian McNish, Yan Pujante, and Chris Saccheri). Founder Reid Hoffman, previously CEO of LinkedIn, is now Chairman of the Board. LinkedIn is headquartered in Mountain View, California, with offices in Omaha, Chicago, New York, London, and Dublin. It is funded by Sequoia Capital, Greylock, Bain Capital Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and the European Founders Fund. LinkedIn reached profitability in March 2006. Through January 2011, the company had received a total of $103 million of investment. In late 2003, Sequoia Capital led the Series A investment in the company. In June 2008, Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, and other venture capital firms purchased a 5% stake in the company for $53 million, giving the company a post-money valuation of approximately $1 billion. In 2010, LinkedIn opened an International Headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, received a $20 million investment from Tiger Global Management LLC at a valuation of approximately $2 billion, and announced its first acquisition, Mspoke, and improved its 1% premium subscription ratio. In October of that year Silicon Valley Insider ranked the company No. 10 on its Top 100 List of most valuable start ups. By December, the company was valued at $1.575 billion in private markets. 2011: IPO. LinkedIn filed for an initial public offering in January 2011 and traded its first shares on May 19, 2011, under the NYSE symbol ""LNKD"", price of IPO was $45 per share. Shares of LinkedIn, which rose as much as 171 percent in their first day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $94.25, more than 109 percent above IPO price. ""Shortly after"" the IPO, the site's underlying infrastructure was revised to allow accelerated revision-release cycles. In 2011, LinkedIn earned $154.6 million in advertising revenue alone, surpassing Twitter, which earned $139.5 million. LinkedIn’s fourth-quarter 2011 earnings soared due to the company's increase in success in the social media world. In the spring of 2012, LinkedIn expanded its office space by 57,120 square feet in the Financial District of San Francisco. In May 2012, LinkedIn announced its 2012 Q1 revenues were up 101% to $188.5 million compared to $93.9 million in Q1 of 2011, with net income increasing 140% over Q1'2011 to $5 million. Revenue for Q2 was estimated to be between $210 to $215 million. In June 2012 cryptographic hashes of approximately 6.4 million LinkedIn user passwords were stolen by hackers who then published the stolen hashes online. In response to the incident, LinkedIn asked its users to change their passwords. Security experts criticized LinkedIn for not salting their password file, and instead using a single iteration of SHA-1. In November 2012, LinkedIn released their third quarter earnings, reporting earnings-per-share of $0.22 on revenue of $252 million. In result of these numbers, LinkedIn's stock was up, trading at roughly $112 a share. Acquisitions. In July 2012, LinkedIn acquired 15 key Digg patents for $4 million including “click a button to vote up a story” patent. Membership. LinkedIn has more than 225 million members in over 200 countries and territories. It is significantly ahead of its competitors Viadeo (50 million) and XING (10 million). The membership grows by approximately two new members every second. About a third of the members are in the United States and 11 million are from Europe. With 20 million users, India has the fastest-growing network of users as of 2013. The Netherlands has the highest adoption rate per capita outside the US at 30%. LinkedIn recently reached 4 million users in UK, 1 million in Spain, and nearly 1 million in Pakistan. In January 2013, the countries with the most LinkedIn users were: Features. One purpose of the site is to allow registered users to maintain a list of contact details of people with whom they have some level of relationship, called ""Connections"". Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. However, if the invitee selects ""I don't know"" or ""Spam"", this counts against the inviter. If the inviter gets too many of such responses, the account may be restricted or closed. This list of connections can then be used in a number of ways: The ""gated-access approach"" (where contact with any professional requires either an existing relationship, or the intervention of a contact of theirs) is intended to build trust among the service's users. LinkedIn participates in the EU's International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. The feature LinkedIn Answers, similar to Yahoo! Answers, allowed users to ask questions for the community to answer. This feature was free, and the main difference from the latter was that questions are potentially more business-oriented, and the identity of the people asking and answering questions is known. As of January 31, 2013, the LinkedIn Answers feature is no longer supported. LinkedIn cites a new 'focus on development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss professional topics across LinkedIn' as the reason for the retirement of the feature. Another LinkedIn feature is LinkedIn Polls. In December 2011, LinkedIn announced that they are rolling out polls to their one million groups. In mid-2008, LinkedIn launched LinkedIn DirectAds as a form of sponsored advertising. In October 2008, LinkedIn revealed plans to open its social network of 30 million professionals globally as a potential sample for business-to-business research. It is testing a potential social-network revenue model-research that to some appears more promising than advertising. On July 23, 2013 LinkedIn announced their Sponsored Updates ad service. Individuals and companies can now pay a fee to have LinkedIn sponsor their content and spread it to their user base. This is a common way for social media sites such as LinkedIn to generate revenue.  Applications. In October 2008, LinkedIn enabled an ""applications platform"" that allows other online services to be embedded within a member's profile page. Among the initial applications were an Amazon Reading List that allows LinkedIn members to display books they are reading, a connection to Tripit, and a Six Apart, WordPress and TypePad application that allows members to display their latest blog postings within their LinkedIn profile. In November 2010, LinkedIn allowed businesses to list products and services on company profile pages; it also permitted LinkedIn members to ""recommend"" products and services and write reviews. Mobile. A mobile version of the site was launched in February 2008, which gives access to a reduced feature set over a mobile phone. The mobile service is available in six languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese and Spanish. In January 2011, LinkedIn acquired CardMunch, a mobile app maker that scans business cards and converts into contacts. In June 2013, CardMunch was noted as an available LinkedIn app. In August 2011, LinkedIn revamped its mobile applications on the iPhone, Android and HTML5. Mobile page views of the application have increased roughly 400% year over year according to CEO Jeff Weiner. Groups. LinkedIn also supports the formation of interest groups, and as of March 29, 2012 there are 1,248,019 such groups whose membership varies from 1 to 744,662. The majority of the largest groups are employment related, although a very wide range of topics are covered mainly around professional and career issues, and there are currently 128,000 groups for both academic and corporate alumni. Groups support a limited form of discussion area, moderated by the group owners and managers. Since groups offer the ability to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of anti-spam solutions, there is a constant stream of spam postings, and there now exist a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose. LinkedIn has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam, but recently took the decision to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammers. Groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group, including most talked about discussions within your professional circles. Groups may be private, accessible to members only or may be open to Internet users in general to read, though they must join in order to post messages. Job listings. LinkedIn allows users to research companies with which they may be interested in working. When typing the name of a given company in the search box, statistics about the company are provided. These may include the ratio of female to male employees, the percentage of the most common titles/positions held within the company, the location of the company's headquarters and offices, or a list of present and former employees. In July 2011, LinkedIn launched a new feature allowing companies to include an ""Apply with LinkedIn"" button on job listing pages. The new plugin will allow potential employees to apply for positions using their LinkedIn profiles as resumes. All applications will also be saved under a ""Saved Jobs"" tab. Skills. LinkedIn allows users to endorse each other's skills. This feature also allows users to efficiently provide commentary on other users profiles – network building is reinforced. However there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content. Influencers. The LinkedIn Influencers program launched in October 2012 and brings together 300+ of the world's top thought leaders to share their professional insights with LinkedIn's 225 million members. Influencer is an invite-only program that features notable leaders from a vast range of industries including Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, Rahm Emanuel, Jamie Dimon, Deepak Chopra, Jack Welch, and Bill Gates. Business units. LinkedIn derives its revenues from three business divisions: Talent Solutions:  Recruiters and corporations pay for:  Marketing Solutions: Premium Subscriptions: LinkedIn users pay for: Some elements of the various subscription services are also on a pay per use basis like InMail. Reception. LinkedIn has been described by online trade publication ""TechRepublic"" as having ""become the de facto tool for professional networking"". LinkedIn has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships. ""LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today,"" according to ""Forbes"". International restrictions. In 2009, Syrian users reported that LinkedIn server stopped accepting connections originating from IP addresses assigned to Syria. The company's customer support stated that services provided by them are subject to US export and re-export control laws and regulations and ""As such, and as a matter of corporate policy, we do not allow member accounts or access to our site from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria."" In February 2011, it was reported that LinkedIn was being blocked in China after calls for a ""Jasmine Revolution"". It was speculated to have been blocked because it is an easy way for dissidents to access Twitter, which had been blocked previously.

Global warming," Global warming  Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about , with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are more than 90% certain that it is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all major industrialized nations. Climate model projections were summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further for their lowest emissions scenario and for their highest. The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations. Future climate change and associated impacts will vary from region to region around the globe. The effects of an increase in global temperature include a rise in sea levels and a change in the amount and pattern of precipitation, as well as a probable expansion of subtropical deserts. Warming is expected to be strongest in the Arctic and would be associated with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Other likely effects of the warming include a more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heat waves, droughts and heavy rainfall, ocean acidification and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes. Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the loss of habitat from inundation. Proposed policy responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects, and possible future geoengineering. Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) climate change. Parties to the UNFCCC have adopted a range of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to assist in adaptation to global warming. Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required, and that future global warming should be limited to below relative to the pre-industrial level. Reports published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Energy Agency suggest that efforts as of the early 21st century to reduce emissions may be inadequate to meet the UNFCCC's target. Observed temperature changes. [[File:WhereIsTheHeatOfGlobalWarming.svg|thumb|260px|alt=refer to caption|The increase in ocean heat content is much larger than any other store of energy in the Earth’s heat balance over the two periods 1961 to 2003 and 1993 to 2003, and accounts for more than 90% of the possible increase in heat content of the Earth system during these periods.]] The Earth's average surface temperature rose by over the period 1906–2005. The rate of warming over the last half of that period was almost double that for the period as a whole ( per decade, versus per decade). The urban heat island effect is very small, estimated to account for less than of warming per decade since 1900. Temperatures in the lower troposphere have increased between 0.13 and (0.22 and ) per decade since 1979, according to satellite temperature measurements. Climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850, with regionally varying fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. The warming that is evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, as documented by many independent scientific groups. Examples include sea level rise (water expands as it warms), widespread melting of snow and ice, increased heat content of the oceans, increased humidity, and the earlier timing of spring events, e.g., the flowering of plants. The probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero. Recent estimates by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and the National Climatic Data Center show that 2005 and 2010 tied for the planet's warmest year since reliable, widespread instrumental measurements became available in the late 19th century, exceeding 1998 by a few hundredths of a degree. Estimates by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) show 2005 as the second warmest year, behind 1998 with 2003 and 2010 tied for third warmest year, however, ""the error estimate for individual years ... is at least ten times larger than the differences between these three years."" The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ""statement on the status of the global climate in 2010"" explains that, ""The 2010 nominal value of ranks just ahead of those of 2005 () and 1998 (), although the differences between the three years are not statistically significant..."" Every year from 1986 to 2012 has seen world annual mean temperatures above the 1961-1990 average.  Temperatures in 1998 were unusually warm because global temperatures are affected by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the strongest El Niño in the past century occurred during that year. Global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long term trends and can temporarily mask them. The relative stability in temperature from 2002 to 2009 is consistent with such an episode. 2010 was also an El Niño year. On the low swing of the oscillation, 2011 as a La Niña year was cooler but it was still the 11th warmest year since records began in 1880. Of the 13 warmest years since 1880, 11 were the years from 2001 to 2011. Over the more recent record, 2011 was the warmest La Niña year in the period from 1950 to 2011, and was close to 1997 which was not at the lowest point of the cycle. Temperature changes vary over the globe. Since 1979, land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures ( per decade against per decade). Ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because the ocean loses more heat by evaporation. The northern hemisphere is also naturally warmer than the southern hemisphere mainly because of meridional heat transport in the oceans which has a differential of about 0.9 petawatts northwards, with an additional contribution from the albedo differences between the polar regions. Since the beginning of industrialisation the interhemispheric temperature difference has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the North. Average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world in the past 100 years, however arctic temperatures are also highly variable. Although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the Northern than Southern Hemisphere this does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to mix between hemispheres. The thermal inertia of the oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects mean that climate can take centuries or longer to adjust to changes in forcing. Climate commitment studies indicate that even if greenhouse gases were stabilized at 2000 levels, a further warming of about () would still occur. Initial causes of temperature changes (external forcings). The climate system can respond to changes in ""external forcings."" External forcings can ""push"" the climate in the direction of warming or cooling. Examples of external forcings include changes in atmospheric composition (e.g., increased concentrations of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in Earth's orbit around the Sun. Orbital cycles vary slowly over tens of thousands of years and at present are in an overall cooling trend which would be expected to lead towards an ice age, but the 20th century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden rise in global temperatures. Greenhouse gases. The greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in the atmosphere warm a planet's lower atmosphere and surface. It was proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, discovered in 1860 by John Tyndall, was first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, and was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by Guy Stewart Callendar. Naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases have a mean warming effect of about . Without the earth's atmosphere the temperature across almost the entire surface of the earth would be below freezing. The major greenhouse gases are water vapor, which causes about 36–70% of the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes 9–26%; methane (CH4), which causes 4–9%; and ozone (O3), which causes 3–7%. Clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases. Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide. According to work published in 2007, the concentrations of CO2 and methane have increased by 36% and 148% respectively since 1750. These levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores. Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago. Fossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in CO2 from human activity over the past 20 years. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use, particularly deforestation. Estimates of global CO2 emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion, including cement production and gas flaring, was 34.8 billion tonnes (9.5 ± 0.5 PgC), an increase of 54% above emissions in 1990. Coal burning was responsible for 43% of the total emissions, oil 34%, gas 18%, cement 4.9% and gas flaring 0.7% In May 2013, it was reported that readings for CO2 taken at the world's primary benchmark site in Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm. According to professor Brian Hoskins, this is likely the first time CO2 levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years. Over the last three decades of the 20th century, gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change. Emissions can be attributed to different regions, e.g., see the figure opposite. Attribution of emissions due to land-use change is a controversial issue. Emissions scenarios, estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases, have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic, sociological, technological, and natural developments. In most scenarios, emissions continue to rise over the century, while in a few, emissions are reduced. Fossil fuel reserves are abundant, and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century. Emission scenarios, combined with modelling of the carbon cycle, have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future. Using the six IPCC SRES ""marker"" scenarios, models suggest that by the year 2100, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 could range between 541 and 970 ppm. This is an increase of 90–250% above the concentration in the year 1750. The popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion, i.e., the destruction of stratospheric ozone by chlorofluorocarbons. Although there are a few areas of linkage, the relationship between the two is not strong. Reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures, while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect. Particulates and soot. Global dimming, a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface, was observed from 1961 until at least 1990. The main cause of this dimming is particulates produced by volcanoes and human made pollutants, which exerts a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight. The effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion – CO2 and aerosols – have largely offset one another in recent decades, so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane. Radiative forcing due to particulates is temporally limited due to wet deposition which causes them to have an atmospheric lifetime of one week. Carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more, and as such, changes in particulate concentrations will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide. In addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, particulates have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget. Sulfates act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets, known as the Twomey effect. This effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size, which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight, known as the Albrecht effect. Indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds, and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds. Indirect effects of particulates represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing. Soot may cool or warm the surface, depending on whether it is airborne or deposited. Atmospheric soot directly absorb solar radiation, which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface. In isolated areas with high soot production, such as rural India, as much as 50% of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds. When deposited, especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions, the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface. The influences of particulates, including black carbon, are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics, particularly in Asia, while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere. [to caption|Contribution of natural factors and human activities to radiative forcing of climate change. Radiative forcing values are for the year 2005, relative to the pre-industrial era (1750). The contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing is 5% the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.]] Solar activity. Since 1978, output from the Sun has been precisely measured by satellites. These measurements indicate that the Sun's output has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the Earth. In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and volcanic activity probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate. Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change. Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings. Another line of evidence against the sun having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere have changed. Models and observations show that greenhouse warming results in warming of the lower atmosphere (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere). Depletion of the ozone layer by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a strong cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun were responsible for observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and stratosphere would be expected. Feedback. The climate system includes a range of ""feedbacks"" which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings. Positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing, while negative feedbacks reduce the response of the climate system to an initial forcing. There are a range of feedbacks in the climate system, including water vapor, changes in ice-albedo (snow and ice cover affect how much the Earth's surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight), clouds, and changes in the Earth's carbon cycle (e.g., the release of carbon from soil). The main negative feedback is the energy which the Earth's surface radiates into space as infrared radiation. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, if temperature doubles, radiated energy increases by a factor of 16 (2 to the 4th power). Feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Other factors being equal, a higher ""climate sensitivity"" means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing. Uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario. More research is needed to understand the role of clouds and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections. The IPCC projections given in the lede span the ""likely"" range (greater than 66% probability, based on expert judgement) for the selected emissions scenarios. However, the IPCC's projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty. The lower end of the ""likely"" range appears to be better constrained than the upper end of the ""likely"" range. Climate models. A climate model is a computerized representation of the five components of the climate system: Atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface, and biosphere. Such models are based on physical principles including fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and radiative transfer. There can be components which represent air movement, temperature, clouds, and other atmospheric properties; ocean temperature, salt content, and circulation; ice cover on land and sea; the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere; chemical and biological processes; and others. Although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible, simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system. Results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model's climate sensitivity. For example, the uncertainty in IPCC's 2007 projections is caused by (1) the use of multiple models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations, (2) the use of differing estimates of humanities' future greenhouse gas emissions, (3) any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models IPCC used to prepare its report, i.e., greenhouse gas releases from permafrost. The models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes. One of the mathematical results of these complex equations is a prediction whether warming or cooling will occur. Recent research has called special attention to the need to refine models with respect to the effect of clouds and the carbon cycle. Models are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human-derived causes. Although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects, they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates. Climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century, but do not simulate all aspects of climate. Not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the IPCC. Observed Arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted. Precipitation increased proportional to atmospheric humidity, and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict. Observed and expected environmental effects. ""Detection"" is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. Detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause. ""Attribution"" of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence. Detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical, ecological and social systems. Natural systems. Global warming has been detected in a number of natural systems. Some of these changes are described in the section on observed temperature changes, e.g., sea level rise and widespread decreases in snow and ice extent. Anthropogenic forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes, including sea level rise, changes in climate extremes (such as the number of warm and cold days), declines in Arctic sea ice extent, and to glacier retreat. Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that global mean sea level could rise by 0.18-0.59 m. The IPCC do not provide a best estimate of global mean sea level rise, and their upper estimate of 59 cm is not an upper-bound, i.e., global mean sea level could rise by more than 59 cm by 2100. The IPCC's projections are conservative, and may underestimate future sea level rise. Over the 21st century, Parris and others suggest that global mean sea level could rise by 0.2 to 2.0 m (0.7-6.6 ft), relative to mean sea level in 1992. Widespread coastal flooding would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for millennia. For example, sustained global warming of more than 2 °C (relative to pre-industrial levels) could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1 to 4 m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small ice caps. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional 4 to 7.5 m over many thousands of years. Changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land, with most warming at high northern latitudes, and least warming over the Southern Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean. During the 21st century, glaciers and snow cover are projected to continue their widespread retreat. Projections of declines in Arctic sea ice vary. Recent projections suggest that Arctic summers could be ice-free (defined as ice extent less than 1 million square km) as early as 2025-2030. Future changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends, with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas, and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions. Projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events, such as heat waves. Ecological systems. In terrestrial ecosystems, the earlier timing of spring events, and poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges, have been linked with high confidence to recent warming. Future climate change is expected to particularly affect certain ecosystems, including tundra, mangroves, and coral reefs. It is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric CO2 levels, combined with higher global temperatures. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems. Increases in atmospheric concentrations have lead to an increase in ocean acidity. Dissolved increases ocean acidity, which is measured by lower pH values. Between 1750 to 2000, surface-ocean pH has decreased by ~0.1, from ~8.2 to ~8.1. Surface-ocean pH has probably not been below ~8.1 during the past 2 million years. Projections suggest that surface-ocean pH could decrease by an additional 0.3-0.4 units by 2100. Future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural resources of value to society. Large-scale and abrupt impacts. Climate change could result in global, large-scale changes in natural and social systems. Two examples are ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and the long-term melting of ice sheets, which contributes to sea level rise. Some large-scale changes could occur abruptly, i.e., over a short time period, and might also be irreversible. An example of abrupt climate change is the rapid release of methane from permafrost, which would lead to amplified global warming. Scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor. However, the probability of abrupt changes appears to be very low. Factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming, warming that occurs more rapidly, and warming that is sustained over longer time periods. Observed and expected effects on social systems. Vulnerability of human societies to climate change mainly lies in the effects of extreme weather events rather than gradual climate change. Impacts of climate change so far include adverse effects on small islands, adverse effects on indigenous populations in high-latitude areas, and small but discernable effects on human health. Over the 21st century, climate change is likely to adversely affect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal flooding, reductions in water supplies, increased malnutrition and increased health impacts. Most economic studies suggest that global warming would reduce world gross domestic product (GDP). Food security. Under present trends, by 2030, maize production in Southern Africa could decrease by up to 30% while rice, millet and maize in South Asia could decrease by up to 10%. By 2080, yields in developing countries could decrease by 10% to 25% on average while India could see a drop of 30% to 40%. By 2100, while the population of three billion is expected to double, rice and maize yields in the tropics are expected to decrease by 20–40% because of higher temperatures without accounting for the decrease in yields as a result of soil moisture and water supplies stressed by rising temperatures. Future warming of around (by 2100, relative to 1990–2000) could result in increased crop yields in mid- and high-latitude areas, but in low-latitude areas, yields could decline, increasing the risk of malnutrition. A similar regional pattern of net benefits and costs could occur for economic (market-sector) effects. Warming above could result in crop yields falling in temperate regions, leading to a reduction in global food production. Habitat inundation. In small islands and megadeltas, inundation as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements. This could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low lying areas such as Bangladesh, as well as statelessness for populations in countries such as the Maldives and Tuvalu. Responses to global warming. Mitigation. [[File:Limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius - options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (PBL).png|thumb|left|300px|alt=Refer to caption and image description|The graph on the right shows three ""pathways"" to meet the UNFCCC's 2 °C target, labelled ""global technology"", ""decentralised solutions"", and ""consumption change"". Each pathway shows how various measures (e.g., improved energy efficiency, increased use of renewable energy) could contribute to emissions reductions. Image credit: PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.]] Reducing the amount of future climate change is called mitigation of climate change. The IPCC defines mitigation as activities that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb GHGs from the atmosphere. Studies indicate substantial potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of emission-reducing activities such as energy conservation, increased energy efficiency, and satisfying more of society's power demands with renewable energy and/or nuclear energy sources. Climate mitigation also includes acts to enhance natural sinks, such as reforestation. In order to limit warming to within the lower range described in the IPCC's ""Summary Report for Policymakers"" it will be necessary to adopt policies that will limit greenhouse gas emissions to one of several significantly different scenarios described in the full report. This will become more and more difficult with each year of increasing volumes of emissions and even more drastic measures will be required in later years to stabilize a desired atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Energy-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2010 were the highest in history, breaking the prior record set in 2008. Adaptation. Other policy responses include adaptation to climate change. Adaptation to climate change may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change, or spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention. Planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis. The barriers, limits, and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood. A concept related to adaptation is ""adaptive capacity"", which is the ability of a system (human, natural or managed) to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with consequences. Unmitigated climate change (i.e., future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions) would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt. Views on global warming. There are different views over what the appropriate policy response to climate change should be. These competing views weigh the benefits of limiting emissions of greenhouse gases against the costs. In general, it seems likely that climate change will impose greater damages and risks in poorer regions. Global warming controversy. The global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes, substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature, regarding the nature, causes, and consequences of global warming. The disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature, especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether humankind has contributed significantly to it, and whether the increase is wholly or partially an artifact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity, predictions of additional warming, and what the consequences of global warming will be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view. From 1990–1997 in the United States, conservative think tanks mobilized to undermine the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They challenged the scientific evidence, argued that global warming will have benefits, and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good. Politics. Most countries are Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system. As is stated in the Convention, this requires that GHG concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion. The Framework Convention was agreed in 1992, but since then, global emissions have risen. During negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing 133 developing nations) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to "" the lead"" in reducing their emissions. This was justified on the basis that: the developed world's emissions had contributed most to the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere; per-capita emissions (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still relatively low in developing countries; and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs. This mandate was sustained in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention, which entered into legal effect in 2005. In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions. These first-round commitments expire in 2012. US President George W. Bush rejected the treaty on the basis that ""it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy."" At the 15th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, held in 2009 at Copenhagen, several UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord. Parties associated with the Accord (140 countries, as of November 2010) aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below . A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests a possible ""emissions gap"" between the voluntary pledges made in the Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a ""likely"" (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the objective. The UNEP assessment takes the objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level. To having a likely chance of meeting the objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter. The 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) was held at Cancún in 2010. It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to above pre-industrial temperatures. It also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of . Public opinion. In 2007–2008 Gallup Polls surveyed 127 countries. Over a third of the world's population was unaware of global warming, with people in developing countries less aware than those in developed, and those in Africa the least aware. Of those aware, Latin America leads in belief that temperature changes are a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the Former Soviet Union lead in the opposite belief. In the Western world, opinions over the concept and the appropriate responses are divided. Nick Pidgeon of Cardiff University said that ""results show the different stages of engagement about global warming on each side of the Atlantic"", adding, ""The debate in Europe is about what action needs to be taken, while many in the US still debate whether climate change is happening."" A 2010 poll by the Office of National Statistics found that 75% of UK respondents were at least ""fairly convinced"" that the world's climate is changing, compared to 87% in a similar survey in 2006. A January 2011 ICM poll in the UK found 83% of respondents viewed climate change as a current or imminent threat, while 14% said it was no threat. Opinion was unchanged from an August 2009 poll asking the same question, though there had been a slight polarisation of opposing views. A survey in October 2009 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press showed decreasing public perception in the US that global warming was a serious problem. All political persuasions showed reduced concern with lowest concern among Republicans, only 35% of whom considered there to be solid evidence of global warming. The cause of this marked difference in public opinion between the US and the global public is uncertain but the hypothesis has been advanced that clearer communication by scientists both directly and through the media would be helpful in adequately informing the American public of the scientific consensus and the basis for it. The US public appears to be unaware of the extent of scientific consensus regarding the issue, with 59% believing that scientists disagree ""significantly"" on global warming. By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat. In the US, a little over half the population (53%) now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10% below the 2008 poll (63%). Latin America had the biggest rise in concern, with 73% saying global warming was a serious threat to their families. That global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in the USA where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to natural causes. On the other hand, in May 2011 a joint poll by Yale and George Mason Universities found that nearly half the people in the USA (47%) attribute global warming to human activities, compared to 36% blaming it on natural causes. Only 5% of the 35% who were ""disengaged"", ""doubtful"", or ""dismissive"" of global warming were aware that 97% of publishing US climate scientists agree global warming is happening and is primarily caused by humans. Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that the public's belief as to the causes of global warming depends on the wording choice used in the polls. In the United States, according to the Public Policy Institute of California's (PPIC) eleventh annual survey on environmental policy issues, 75% said they believe global warming is a very serious or somewhat serious threat to the economy and quality of life in California. A September 2011 Angus Reid Public Opinion poll found that Britons (43%) are less likely than Americans (49%) or Canadians (52%) to say that ""global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities."" The same poll found that 20% of Americans, 20% of Britons and 14% of Canadians think ""global warming is a theory that has not yet been proven."" A March 2013 survey by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found that 69% say there is solid evidence that the earth’s average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009. An October 2012 survey also found that since 2009 an increasing percentage of Americans think that global warming is not natural, reporting that 42% of Americans believed that global warming is mostly caused by human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, up from 38% in 2011 and 34% in 2010. Climatologists. Most scientists agree that humans are contributing to observed climate change. A meta study of academic papers concerning global warming, published between 1991 and 2011 and accessible from Web of Knowledge, found that among those whose abstracts expressed a position on the cause of global warming, 97.2% supported the consensus view that it is man made. In an October 2011 paper published in the ""International Journal of Public Opinion Research"", researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 489 American scientists working in academia, government, and industry. Of those surveyed, 97% agreed that that global temperatures have risen over the past century and 84% agreed that ""human-induced greenhouse warming"" is now occurring, only 5% disagreeing that human activity is a significant cause of global warming. National science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions. Others. Some people question aspects of climate-change science, see: list of scientists opposing global warming consensus. Organizations such as the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, conservative commentators, and some companies such as ExxonMobil have challenged IPCC climate change scenarios, funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus, and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls. In the finance industry, Deutsche Bank has set up an institutional climate change investment division (DBCCA), which has commissioned and published research on the issues and debate surrounding global warming. Environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail, while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions. Some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years, or called for policies to reduce global warming. Etymology. The term ""global warming"" was probably first used in its modern sense on 8 August 1975 in a science paper by Wally Broecker in the journal ""Science"" called ""Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?"". Broecker's choice of words was new and represented a significant recognition that the climate was warming; previously the phrasing used by scientists was ""inadvertent climate modification,"" because while it was recognized humans could change the climate, no one was sure which direction it was going. The National Academy of Sciences first used ""global warming"" in a 1979 paper called the Charney Report, which said: ""if carbon dioxide continues to increase, find no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible."" The report made a distinction between referring to surface temperature changes as ""global warming"", while referring to other changes caused by increased CO2 as ""climate change"". ""Global warming"" became more widely popular after 1988 when NASA climate scientist James Hansen used the term in a testimony to Congress. He said: ""global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming."" His testimony was widely reported and afterward ""global warming"" was commonly used by the press and in public discourse. "
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action," Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action  Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) refers to a set of policies and actions that countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The term recognizes that different countries may take different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It also emphasizes financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries to reduce emissions.  NAMA was first used in the Bali Action Plan as part of the Bali Road Map agreed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali in December 2007, and also formed part of the Copenhagen Accord issued following the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen (COP 15) in December 2009.  History of the use of NAMA in international agreements. Bali Action Plan (December 2007). The Bali Action Plan is centered on four main building blocks: (i) Mitigation, (ii) Adaptation, (iii) Technology, and (iv) Financing, with NAMA forming an important part of the mitigation component.  The Bali Action Plan called for future discussions to address: Copenhagen Climate Conference (December 2009). The Copenhagen Climate Conference did not produce the global agreement envisaged in the Bali Road Map. The Copenhagen Accord, however, did retain the concept of NAMA, but in a narrower definition only applying to Non-Annex 1 countries, and did not specify what form they should take: What is meant by Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action? India has argued that NAMA means ""voluntary reductions"" by developing countries that ""require to be supported and enabled"" by technology transfer from developed countries.  By definition, NAMAs will vary by country. Indonesia, for example, might focus on integrating climate change policy with other aspects of economic development, such as progressive reduction in oil subsidies, poverty reduction through promotion of alternative income to reduce illegal logging, and exploit more fully the country’s renewable resources, especially geothermal. Implementation of NAMA. In 2010, no NAMAs were implemented yet. The Program of Activities (PoA) under the Clean Development Mechanism is regarded a precedor of a future NAMA mechanism and already operational. Status of NAMA submissions. As of September 2012, about 50 countries have submitted information of their NAMA to the UNFCCC. The detailed contents of their submissions vary greatly on each country, ranging from their intention to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, target sectors, specific actions to be taken, to GHG emissions reduction targets.  Criticism of NAMA. Some have criticized NAMA as heading away from carbon pricing and encouraging enormous subsidy programs funded by developed countries and implemented on a voluntary basis by developing countries. "
Nigel Lawson," Nigel Lawson  Nigel Lawson, Baron Lawson of Blaby, PC (born 11 March 1932) is a British Conservative politician and journalist. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the constituency of Blaby from 1974 to 1992, and served in the Thatcher Cabinet from 1981 to 1989. Prior to entering the Cabinet, he served as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury from May 1979 until his promotion to Secretary of State for Energy. He was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer in June 1983. In both Cabinet posts he was a key proponent of Thatcher's policy of privatisation of several key industries and deregulation and oversaw the Big Bang launched in London on October 27, 1986. Lawson resigned in protest in October 1989. Created a life peer in 1992, he now sits in the House of Lords. He is the father of food writer and celebrity cook Nigella Lawson and of journalist Dominic Lawson. Early life. Lawson was born in 1932 to a wealthy Jewish family living at Hampstead. His father, Ralph Lawson (1904–1982), was the owner of a commodity-trading firm in the City of London, while his mother, Joan Elisa Davis, was also from a prosperous family of stockbrokers. His paternal grandfather Gustav Leibson, a merchant from Mitau (now Jelgava in Latvia) changed his name from Leibson to Lawson after becoming a British Citizen in 1911. Lawson was educated at Westminster School (following in his father's footsteps) and Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a first class honours degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, He carried out his National Service as a Royal Navy officer, during which time he commanded a fast patrol boat, HMS ""Gay Charger"". Lawson began his career as a financial journalist and progressed to the positions of City editor of ""The Sunday Telegraph"" in 1961 and editor of ""The Spectator"" (1966–1970). Early political career. Lawson stood unsuccessfully at the 1970 General Election for the Eton and Slough seat before becoming Member of Parliament for Blaby in Leicestershire in February 1974, which he held until retiring at the 1992 General Election. While in Opposition, Lawson co-ordinated tactics with rebellious Government backbenchers Jeff Rooker and Audrey Wise to secure legislation providing for the automatic indexation of tax thresholds to prevent the tax burden being increased by inflation (typically in excess of 10% per annum during that Parliament). In government. Financial Secretary to the Treasury. On the election of Margaret Thatcher's government, Lawson was appointed to the post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Although this is the fourth-ranking political position in the UK Treasury, Lawson's energy in office was reflected in such measures as the ending of unofficial state controls on mortgage lending, the abolition of exchange controls in October 1979 and the publication of the Medium Term Financial Strategy. This document set the course for both the monetary and fiscal sides of the new government's economic policy, though the extent to which the subsequent trajectory of policy and outcome matched that projected is still a matter for debate. Secretary of State for Energy. In the Cabinet reshuffle of September 1981, Lawson was promoted to the position of Secretary of State for Energy. In this role his most significant action was to prepare for what he saw as an inevitable full-scale strike in the coal industry (then state-owned since nationalisation by the post-war government of Clement Attlee) over the closure of pits whose uneconomic operation accounted for the coal industry's business losses and consequent requirement for state subsidy. He was a key proponent of the Thatcher Government's privatisation policy. During his tenure at the Department of Energy he set the course for the later privatisations of the gas and electricity industries and on his return to the Treasury he worked closely with the Department of Trade and Industry in privatising British Airways, British Telecom, and British Gas. Chancellor of the Exchequer. After the Government's re-election in 1983, Lawson was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in succession to Geoffrey Howe. The early years of Lawson's chancellorship were associated with tax reform. The 1984 Budget reformed corporate taxes by a combination of reduced rates and reduced allowances. The 1985 Budget continued the trend of shifting from direct to indirect taxes by reducing National Insurance contributions for the lower-paid while extending the base of value added tax. During these two years Lawson's public image remained low-key, but from the 1986 Budget (in which he resumed the reduction of the standard rate of personal Income Tax from the 30% rate to which it had been lowered in Howe's 1979 Budget), his stock rose as unemployment began to fall from the middle of 1986 (employment growth having resumed over three years earlier). Lawson also changed the budget deficit from £10.5 billion (3.7% of GDP) in 1983 to a budget surplus of £3.9 billion in 1988 and £4.1 billion in 1989, the year of his resignation. During his tenure the rate of taxation also came down. The basic rate was reduced from 30% in 1983 to 25% by 1988. The top rate of tax also came down from 60% to 40% in 1988 and the four other higher rates were removed, leaving a system of personal taxation in which there was no rate anywhere in excess of 40 per cent. The trajectory taken by the UK economy from this point on is typically described as ""The Lawson Boom"" by analogy with the phrase ""The Barber Boom"" which describes an earlier period of rapid expansion under the tenure as Chancellor of Anthony Barber in the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Heath (1970 to 1974). Critics of Lawson assert that a combination of the abandonment of monetarism, the adoption of a ""de facto"" exchange-rate target of 3 Deutsche marks to the pound (ruling out interest-rate rises), and excessive fiscal laxity (in particular the 1988 Budget) unleashed an inflationary spiral. Lawson, in his own defence, attributes the boom largely to the effects of various measures of financial deregulation. Insofar as Lawson acknowledges policy errors, he attributes them to a failure to raise interest rates during 1986 and considers that had Margaret Thatcher not vetoed the UK joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in November 1985 it might have been possible to adjust to these beneficial changes in the arena of microeconomics with less macroeconomic turbulence. Lawson also ascribes the difficulty of conducting monetary policy to Goodhart's Law. His tax cuts, beginning in 1986, resulted in the ""Lawson Boom"" of the British economy, which had halved unemployment from more than 3,000,000 by the end of 1989. However, this led to a rise in inflation from 3% to more than 8% during 1988, which resulted in interest rates doubling to 15% in the space of 18 months, and remaining high in spite of the 1990–1992 recession which saw unemployment rise nearly as high as the level seen before the boom began. Lawson opposed the introduction of the Community Charge (nicknamed the ""poll tax"") as a replacement for the previous rating system for the local financing element of local government revenue. His dissent was confined to deliberations within the Cabinet, where he found few allies and where he was overruled by the Prime Minister and by the ministerial team of the department responsible (Department of the Environment). The issue of exchange-rate mechanism membership continued to fester between Lawson and Thatcher and was exacerbated by the re-employment by Thatcher of Sir Alan Walters as personal economic adviser. Lawson's conduct of policy had become a struggle to maintain credibility once the August 1988 trade deficit revealed the strength of the expansion of domestic demand. As orthodox monetarists, Lawson and Thatcher agreed to a steady rise in interest rates to restrain demand, but this had the effect of inflating the headline inflation figure. Resignation. After a further year in office in these circumstances Lawson felt that public articulation of differences between an exchange-rate monetarist, as he had become, and the views of Walters (who continued to favour a floating exchange rate) were making his job impossible and he resigned. He was succeeded in the office of Chancellor by John Major. Lawson's tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer was longer than that of any of his predecessors since David Lloyd George, who served from 1908 to 1915. This was subsequently passed by Labour's Gordon Brown in September 2003, having been appointed to the position in May 1997 by Tony Blair on Labour's return to government after 18 years. Brown would ultimately spend 10 years in the position until he became Prime Minister in June 2007. Retirement. After retiring from front-bench politics, Lawson decided, on his doctor's advice, to tackle his weight problem. He is 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall; he lost five stone (70 pounds, 30 kg) from 238 pounds (108 kg) to 168 pounds (76 kilograms) – (BMI 34 to 24) in a matter of a few months, dramatically changing his appearance, and went on to publish the best-selling ""The Nigel Lawson Diet Book"". On 1 July 1992 he was given a life peerage as Baron Lawson of Blaby, of Newnham in the County of Northamptonshire. In 1996, Lawson appeared on the BBC satirical and topical quiz show ""Have I Got News For You"" and, as a former Chancellor (regarded as one of the ""big four"" Government positions, ""q.v."". Great Offices of State) became something of a coup as the guest who had previously held the highest political office. He was, however, happy to go with the flow and take a mild amount of ribbing from the regulars as he was plugging his diet book at the time. He occasionally appears as a guest on his daughter Nigella's cookery shows. Lord Lawson serves on the advisory board of the Conservative magazine ""Standpoint"". Position on global warming. Lawson is very sceptical about climate change and believes that man-made global warming is exaggerated. In 2004, along with six others, Lawson wrote a letter to ""The Times"" criticising the Kyoto Protocol and claiming that there were substantial scientific uncertainties surrounding climate change. In 2005, the House of Lords Economics Affairs Select Committee, with Lawson as a member, undertook an inquiry into climate change. In their report, the Committee recommend the HM Treasury take a more active role in climate policy. The objectivity of the IPCC process is questioned, and changes are suggested in the UK's contribution to future international climate change negotiations. The report cites a mismatch between the economic costs and benefits of climate policy, and also criticises the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets set in the Kyoto Protocol. In response to the report, Michael Grubb, Chief Economist of the Carbon Trust, wrote an article in ""Prospect"" magazine, defending the Kyoto Protocol and describing the committee's report as being ""strikingly inconsistent"". Lawson responded to Grubb's article, describing it as an example of the ""intellectual bankruptcy of the [...] climate change establishment"". Lawson also said that Kyoto's approach was ""wrong-headed"" and called on the IPCC to be ""shut down"". At about the same time of the release of the House of Lords report, the UK Government launched the Stern Review, an inquiry undertaken by the HM Treasury and headed by Lord Stern. According to the ""Stern Review"", published in 2006, the potential costs of climate change far exceed the costs of a programme to stabilise the climate. Lawson's lecture to the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, published 1 November 2006 criticises the Stern Review and proposed what is described as a rational approach, advocating adaptation to changes in global climate, rather than attempting mitigation, i.e., reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Lawson also contributed to the 2007 documentary film ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"". In 2008, Lawson published a book expanding on his 2006 lecture to the Centre for Policy Studies, """". He argues the case that, although global warming is happening and will have negative consequences, the impact of these changes will be relatively moderate rather than apocalyptic. He criticises those ""alarmist"" politicians and scientists who predict catastrophe unless urgent action is taken. The book has, in its turn, been criticised by several climatologists: HM Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir John Beddington, is reported to have told Lawson privately that he had ""incorrect"" and ""misleading"" claims in the book. In July 2008 controversy was again incited when the Conservative magazine ""Standpoint"" published a transcript of a double interview with Lawson and Tory Policy Chief Oliver Letwin, in which Lawson described Letwin's views on global warming as ""pie in the sky"" and called on him and the Tory frontbench to ""get real"". On 23 November 2009 Lord Lawson became chairman of a new think tank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a registered education charity. In 2011, Bob Ward claimed the GWPF was ""spreading errors"" and ""the 'facts'"" Lawson ""repeats are demonstrably inaccurate"" Ward referred to Lawson's ""many times"" repeated statement that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change worst case scenario predicted the rise in Third World living standards in 100 years would be limited to just nine times current levels. In fact, said Ward, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report estimates living standard will rise by a factor of 66 but crucially makes no assessment of how it will be affected by climate change. Ward also criticised Lawson for repeating in a 2010 BBC radio debate that Antarctic ice volumes were unchanged even after his error was highlighted by his opponent, Professor Kevin Anderson. According to Ward, Lawson provided no evidence to back his claim which is contrary to satellite measurements and he similarly incorrectly implied that the correlation between CO2 and sea levels was uncertain as sea levels were rising more slowly since 1950 than before it. The current sea level rise is accelerating. Given the Charity Commission requires that statements by campaigning charities ""must be factually accurate and have a legitimate evidence base"" Ward suggested that they review the GWPF. Lawson's son Dominic Lawson is also a climate change sceptic, taking a similar viewpoint as his father in his columns in the ""Independent on Sunday"". Economy. Lawson has been a critic of David Cameron's coalition government economic policy, describing spending cuts consultation plans as a ""PR ploy"". In November 2011 he called for the ""orderly"" dismantling of the euro. In the media. Lawson was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series ""Tory! Tory! Tory!"". In 2010, he appeared on the ""Analysis"" programme to discuss banking reform. Lawson explained that the 2007–2012 global financial crisis was an unintended consequence of the 1986 Big Bang after investment banks merged with high street banks putting depositors' savings at risk. Lawson has also appeared on the Business News Network in Canada to discuss global warming. Lawson is known for having coined several notable quotations, including ""o govern is to choose. To appear to be unable to choose is to appear to be unable to govern."" Personal and family life. Lord Lawson has been married and divorced twice: His six children (who can use the prefix of Hon, should they so wish) are journalist and TV presenter and food writer Nigella Lawson, the late Thomasina Lawson (married Ivan Hill), Horatia Lawson (married to The Hon Charles Thomas, elder son of Lord Thomas of Swynnerton), Dominic Lawson, former editor of ""The Sunday Telegraph"", Tom Lawson (deputy head at Christ's Hospital). Lord Lawson is a member of the Garrick, Beefsteak and Pratt's Clubs. "
Connie Hedegaard," Connie Hedegaard  Connie Hedegaard (born 15 September 1960) is a Danish politician and public intellectual who has been European Commissioner for Climate Action in the (second Barroso) European Commission since 10 February 2010. On behalf of Denmark, she hosted the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen 2009. She was Danish Minister for Climate and Energy from 23 November 2007 as a member of the Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen III and that of Lars Løkke Rasmussen and had been the Danish Minister for the Environment from 2 August 2004 to 23 November 2007, as a member of the Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I and II.  In Denmark, she was a member of the Conservative People's Party (DKF), and was a member of parliament (Folketing) from 10 January 1984 to 3 October 1990. She was also elected a member of the Folketing in the 2005 Danish parliamentary election. Prior to becoming a minister, she worked as a journalist at DR, the Danish national broadcaster. Priorities as European Commissioner. Taking up her new position at the European Commission on 10 February 2010, Connie Hedegaard stressed the importance of climate change in the 21st century. She hoped that by the end of her five-year term, Europe would be the most climate friendly region in the world. Her priorities would be to implement the European Climate and Energy package and to continue her efforts towards an ambitious international climate agreement. According to the mandate outlined by President Barroso, her principal responsibilities as Commissioner for Climate Action will be to: In order to carry out her responsibilities, Connie Hedegaard will be in charge of the newly created Directorate-General for Climate Action which builds on the climate directorate which was previously in the Directorate-General for Environment. Background. Connie Hedegaard holds an MA in Literature and History. She has been a member of the Conservative Party and active in government on and off since 1984, when she was elected as the hitherto youngest member of the Folketing, the Danish national parliament, where she sat for six years. In 1990, she left politics to pursue a career in journalism. Over the next 14 years, she worked as a journalist at the newspaper Berlingske Tidende, took the post of Director of DR Radio News, and was the anchor for Deadline, a Danish TV news program. Diving back into politics in 2004, she became Minister of the Environment. A year later, she became Minister for Nordic Cooperation. After the November 2007 general election, she was chosen as Minister for Climate and Energy. In May 2008, she told Denmark, “Sustainable economic growth is an attainable objective. The Nordic Region has made great progress with solutions based on environmental technology, and some day it will be possible to stockpile energy generated from renewable sources such as windmills, and to run vehicles purely on excess energy.”  Her most recent important assignment has been preparing and hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen. Connie Hedegaard and Denmark's energy policies. Since 2007, Connie Hedegaard has been behind Denmark’s energy policies. In April, she signed an action plan with India on renewable energy. One notable achievement was her role in introducing Denmark’s Energy Policy 2008–2011. The policy made her country the first in the world to commit to an overall energy reduction, not just a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It includes the following language. "
Climate change," Climate change policy of the George W. Bush administration  This article is about the climate change policy of the United States under the George W. Bush administration. Kyoto Protocol. In March 2001, the Bush Administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan that would require nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, claiming that ratifying the treaty would create economic setbacks in the U.S. and does not put enough pressure to limit emissions from developing nations. In February 2002, Bush announced his alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, by bringing forth a plan to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gasses by 18 percent over 10 years. The intensity of greenhouse gasses specifically is the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions and economic output, meaning that under this plan, emissions would still continue to grow, but at a slower pace. Bush stated that this plan would prevent the release of 500 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, which is about the equivalent of 70 million cars from the road. This target would achieve this goal by providing tax credits to businesses that use renewable energy sources. Influence of industry groups. In June 2005, US State Department papers showed the Bush administration thanking Exxon executives for the company's ""active involvement"" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the U.S. stance on Kyoto. Input from the business lobby group Global Climate Coalition was also a factor. The Bush administration implemented an industry-formulated disinformation campaign designed to actively mislead the American public on global warming and to forestall limits on ""climate polluters,"" according to a report in ""Rolling Stone"" magazine which reviews hundreds of internal government documents and former government officials. ""'They've got a political clientele that does not want to be regulated,' says Rick S. Piltz, a former Bush climate official who blew the whistle on White House censorship of global-warming documents in 2005. 'Any honest discussion of the science would stimulate public pressure for a stronger policy. They're not stupid.' ""Bush's do-nothing policy on global warming began almost as soon as he took office. By pursuing a carefully orchestrated policy of delay, the White House blocked even the most modest reforms and replaced them with token investments in futuristic solutions like hydrogen cars. 'It's a charade,' says Jeremy Symons, who represented the EPA on Dick Cheney's energy task force, the industry-studded group that met in secret to craft the administration's energy policy. 'They have a single-minded determination to do nothing—while making it look like they are doing something.' . . . ""The CEQ became Cheney's shadow EPA, with industry calling the shots. To head up the council, Cheney installed James Connaughton, a former lobbyist for industrial polluters, who once worked to help General Electric and ARCO skirt responsibility for their Superfund waste sites. ""two weeks after Bush took office - ExxonMobil's top lobbyist, Randy Randol, demanded a housecleaning of the scientists in charge of studying global warming. . . .Exxon's wish was the CEQ's command. Political pressure on scientists. Also according to testimony taken by the U.S. House of Representatives, the Bush White House pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming ""High-quality science"" was ""struggling to get out,"" as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. ""Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications."" Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the Government Accountability Project, the White House attempted to bury the report ""National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,"" produced by U.S. scientists pursuant to U.S. law. Some U.S. scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming. Also, the White House removed key portions of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report given to the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee about the dangers to human health of global warming. According to one CDC official familiar with both the CDC version and the version given to the Senate, the version given to the Senate was ""eviscerated."" The White House prevented the Senate and thus the public from receiving key CDC estimates in the report about diseases likely to flourish in a warmer climate, increased injuries and deaths from severe weather such as hurricanes, more respiratory problems from drought-driven air pollution, an increase in waterborne diseases including cholera, increases in vector-borne diseases including malaria and hantavirus, mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress, and how many people might be adversely affected because of increased warming. US officials, such as Philip Cooney, have repeatedly edited scientific reports from US government scientists, Climate scientist James E. Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, claimed in a widely cited ""New York Times"" article in 2006 that his superiors at the agency were trying to ""censor"" information ""going out to the public."" NASA denied this, saying that it was merely requiring that scientists make a distinction between personal, and official government, views in interviews conducted as part of work done at the agency. Several scientists working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have made similar complaints; once again, government officials said they were enforcing long-standing policies requiring government scientists to clearly identify personal opinions as such when participating in public interviews and forums. The BBC's long-running current affairs series ""Panorama"" recently investigated the issue, and was told that ""scientific reports about global warming have been systematically changed and suppressed."" According to an Associated Press release on January 30, 2007, Critics writing in the ""Wall Street Journal"" editorial page claim that the survey was itself unscientific. Attempts to suppress scientific information on global warming and other issues have been described by Chris Mooney as constituting a Republican War on Science. Allegations of attempts to mislead the public. The book ""Hell and High Water"" asserts that there has been a disingenuous, concerted and effective campaign to convince Americans that the science is not proven, or that global warming is the result of natural cycles, and that there needs to be more research. The book claims that, to delay action, industry and government spokesmen suggest falsely that ""technology breakthroughs"" will eventually save us with hydrogen cars and other fixes. It calls on voters to demand immediate government action to curb emissions. Tyler Hamilton, in his review of the book for The Toronto Star, wrote that the book offers ""alarming detail on how the U.S. public was being misled by Bush administration (backed by conservative political forces) that is intent on inaction, and that's also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions."" Papers presented at an International Scientific Congress on Climate Change, held in 2009 under the sponsorship of the University of Copenhagen in cooperation with nine other universities in the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), maintained that the climate-change skepticism which is so prevalent in the USA ""was largely generated and kept alive by a small number of conservative think tanks, often with direct funding from industries having special interests in delaying or avoiding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions"". In ""Merchants of Doubt"" (2010) Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, both American science historians, argue that Fred Seitz, Fred Singer, and a few other contrarian scientists joined forces with conservative think tanks and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change, by spreading doubt and confusion. In ""Requiem for a Species"" (2010), Clive Hamilton suggests that the roots of climate change denial lie in the reaction of American conservatism to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He argues that as the ""red menace"" receded, conservatives who had put energy into opposing communism sought other outlets. Hamilton contends that the conservative backlash against climate science was led by three prominent physicists -- Frederick Seitz, Robert Jastrow, and William Nierenberg. Attempts to undermine U.S. and state efforts. The Bush Administration worked to undermine state efforts to mitigate global warming. Mary Peters, the Transportation Secretary at that, time personally directed US efforts to urge governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California’s first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress. "
Kyoto Protocol," Kyoto Protocol and government action  This article is about the Kyoto Protocol and government action in relation to that treaty. Annex I. In total, Annex I Parties managed a cut of 3.3% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1990 and 2004 (UNFCCC, 2007, p. 11). In 2007, projections indicated rising emissions of 4.2% between 1990 and 2010. This projection assumed that no further mitigation action would be taken. The reduction in the 1990s was driven significantly by economic restructuring in the economies-in-transition (EITs. See the main Kyoto Protocol article for the list of EITs). Emission reductions in the EITs had little to do with climate change policy (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 24). Some reductions in Annex I emissions have occurred due to policy measures, such as promoting energy efficiency (UNFCCC, 2007, p. 11). Australia. On the change of government following the election in November 2007, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd signed the ratification immediately after assuming office on 3 December 2007, just before the meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; it took effect in March, 2008. Australia's target is to limit its emissions to 8% above their 1990 level over the 2008–2012 period, i.e., their average emissions over the 2008–2012 period should be kept below 108% of their 1990 level (IEA, 2005, p. 51). According the Australian government, Australia should meet its Kyoto target (IEA, 2005, p. 56; DCCEE, 2010). When he was in the opposition, Rudd commissioned Ross Garnaut to report on the economic effects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The report was submitted to the Australian government on 30 September 2008. The policy of the Rudd government contrasts with that of the former Australian government, which refused to ratify the agreement on the ground that following the protocol would be costly, and that countries like India and China with expanding economies and large population would not have any obligations. Furthermore, it was claimed that Australia was already doing enough to cut emissions, with a pledge of $300 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over three years. Policy. Australia's position, under Prime Minister John Howard, was that it did not intend to ratify the treaty (IEA, 2005, p. 51). The justification for this was that: The Howard government did intend to meet its Kyoto target, but without ratification (IEA, 2005, p. 51). As part of the 2004 budget, A$1.8 billion was committed towards its climate change strategy. A$700 million was directed towards low-emission technologies (IEA, 2005, p. 56). The Howard government, along with the United States, agreed to sign the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate at the ASEAN regional forum on 28 July 2005. Furthermore, the state of New South Wales (NSW) commenced the NSW greenhouse gas abatement scheme. This mandatory scheme of greenhouse gas emissions trading commenced on 1 January 2003 and is currently in trial by the state government in NSW alone. Notably, this scheme allows accredited certificate providers to trade emissions from households in the state. As of 2006, the scheme is still in place despite the outgoing Prime Minister's clear dismissal of emissions trading as a credible solution to climate change. Following the example of NSW, the national emissions trading scheme (NETS) has been established as an initiative of state and territory governments of Australia, all of which have Labor Party governments, except Western Australia. The purpose of NETS is to establish an intra-Australian carbon trading scheme to coordinate policy among regions. As the Constitution of Australia does not refer specifically to environmental matters (apart from water), the allocation of responsibility is to be resolved at a political level. In the later years of the Howard administration (1996–2007), the states governed by the Labor took steps to establish a NETS (a) to take action in a field where there were few mandatory federal steps and (b) as a means of facilitating ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the incoming Labor government. In May 2009, Kevin Rudd delayed and changed the carbon pollution reduction scheme: Greenpeace Greenpeace has called clause 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol the """"Australia clause"""" on the ground that it unfairly made Australia a major beneficiary. The clause allows annex 1 countries with a high rate of land clearing in 1990 to set the level in that year as a base. Greenpeace argues that since Australia had an extremely high level of land clearing in 1990, Australia's ""baseline"" was unusually high compared to other countries. Emissions. In 2002, Australia represented about 1.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (IEA, 2005, p. 51). Over the 1990–2002 period, Australia's gross emissions rose by 22%, which was surpassed by only four other International Energy Agency (IEA) members (IEA, 2005, p. 54). This was in large part due to economic growth. Net emissions (including changes in land-use and forestry) increased by 1.3% over this period. In 2005, Australia's GHG emissionsa made up 1.2% of the global total (MNP, 2007). Per-capita emissions are a country's total emissions divided by its population (Banuri ""et al""., 1996, p. 95). In 2005, per capita emissions in Australia were 26.3 tons per capitaa (MNP, 2007). Canada. On 17 December 2002, Canada ratified the treaty that came into force in February 2005, requiring it to reduce emissions to 6% below 1990 levels during the 2008–2012 commitment period (IEA, 2004, p. 52). Under Canada's Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act (KPIA), the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) is required to respond to the government's climate change plans (Canadian Government, 2010). In the assessment of NRTEE (2008), ""Canada is not pursuing a policy objective of meeting the Kyoto Protocol emissions reductions targets. [...] projected emissions profile described in the 2008 [government plan would leave Canada in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol."" On 13 December 2011, a day after the end of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Canada's environment minister, Peter Kent, announced that Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. Emissions. In 2001, Canadian emissions had grown by more than 20% above their 1990 level (IEA, 2004, p. 49). High population and economic growth, added to the expansion of CO2 emissions-intensive sectors, such as oil sand production, were responsible for this growth in emissions. By 2004, CO2 emissions had risen to 27% above the level in 1990. In 2006 they were down to 21.7% above 1990 levels. In 2005, Canada's GHG emissionsa made up 2% of the global total (MNP, 2007). Per capita emissions in Canada were 23.2 tons per capita. Projections In 2004, Canada's emission projections under a business-as-usual scenario (i.e., predicted emissions should policy not be changed) indicated a rise of 33% on the 1990 level by 2010 (IEA, 2004, p. 52). This is a gap of approximately 240 Mt between its target and projected emissions. Politics. When the treaty was ratified in 2002, numerous polls showed support for the Kyoto protocol at around 70%. Despite strong public support, there was still some opposition, particularly by the Canadian Alliance, a precursor to the governing Conservative Party, some business groups, and energy concerns, using arguments similar to those being voiced in the U.S. In particular, there was a fear that since U.S. companies would not be affected by the Kyoto Protocol, Canadian companies would be at a disadvantage. In 2005, a ""war of words"" was ongoing, primarily between Alberta, Canada's primary oil and gas producer, and the federal government. Between 1998 and 2004, Canada committed $3.7 billion towards investment on climate change activities (IEA, 2004, p. 52). The Climate Change Plan for Canada, released in November 2002, described priority areas for climate change policy. In January 2006, a Conservative minority government under Stephen Harper was elected, who previously has expressed opposition to Kyoto, and in particular to the international emission trading. Rona Ambrose, who replaced Stéphane Dion as the environment minister, has since endorsed and expressed interests in some types of emission trading. On 25 April 2006, Ambrose announced that Canada would have no chance of meeting its targets under Kyoto, but would look to participate in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate sponsored by the U.S. ""We've been looking at the Asia-Pacific Partnership for a number of months now because the key principles around are very much in line with where our government wants to go,"" Ambrose told reporters. On 2 May 2006, it was reported that the funding to meet the Kyoto standards had been cut, while the Harper government develops a new plan to take its place. As the co-chair of the UN Climate Change Conference in Nairobi in November 2006, the Canadian government received criticism from environmental groups and other governments for its position. On 4 January 2007, Rona Ambrose moved from the Ministry of the Environment to become Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The environment portfolio went to John Baird, the former President of the Treasury Board. The federal government has introduced legislation to set mandatory emissions targets for industry, but they will not take effect until 2012, with a benchmark date of 2006 as opposed to Kyoto's 1990. The government has since begun working with opposition parties to modify the legislation. A private member's bill was put forth by Pablo Rodriguez, Liberal, to force the government to ""ensure that Canada meets its global climate change obligations under the Kyoto Protocol."" With the support of the Liberals, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois, and with the current minority situation, the bill passed the House of Commons on 14 February 2007 with a vote of 161 to 113. The Senate passed the bill, and it received Royal Assent on 22 June 2007. However, the government, as promised, has largely ignored the bill, which was to force the government 60 days to form a detailed plan, citing economic reasons. In May 2007, the Friends of the Earth sued the federal government for failing to meet the Kyoto Protocol obligations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The obligations were based on a clause in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act that requires Ottawa to ""prevent air pollution that violates an international agreement binding on Canada"". Canada's obligation to the treaty began in 2008. Regardless of the federal policy, some provinces are pursuing policies to restrain emissions, including Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba as part of the Western Climate Initiative. Since 2003 Alberta operates a carbon offset program. Environmental groups Environmental groups in Canada are working together to demand that Canadian politicians take the threat of climate change seriously and make the necessary changes to ensure the safety and health of future generations. Participating groups have created a petition called KYOTOplus, on which signatories commit to the following acts: • set a national target to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 25 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020; • implement an effective national plan to reach this target and help developing countries adapt and build low-carbon economies; and • adopt a strengthened second phase of the Kyoto Protocol at the United Nations climate change conference at Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009. KYOTOplus is a national, non-partisan, petition-centered campaign for urgent federal government action on climate change. There are over fifty partner organizations, including: Climate Action Network Canada, Sierra Club Canada, Sierra Youth Coalition, Oxfam Canada, the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition, Greenpeace Canada, KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives and the David Suzuki Foundation. Withdrawal of Canada. On 13 December 2011, Canada's environment minister, Peter Kent, announced that Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. The announcement was a day after the end of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference (the 17th Conference of the Parties, or ""COP 17""). At COP 17, the representatives of the Canadian government gave their support to a new international climate change agreement that ""includes commitments from all major emitters."" Canadian representatives also stated that ""the Kyoto Protocol is not where the solution lies - it is an agreement that covers fewer than 30 per cent of global emissions (...)."" The Canadian government invoked Canada's legal right to formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol on 12 December 2011. Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990. Environment minister Peter Kent cited Canada's liability to ""enormous financial penalties"" under the treaty unless it withdrew. He also suggested that the recently signed Durban agreement may provide an alternative way forward. Commentary. Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, said that she regretted Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto treaty, and that “or not Canada is a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, it has a legal obligation under the [UNFCCC to reduce its emissions, and a moral obligation to itself and future generations to lead in the global effort.” Canada's decision received a mostly negative response from representatives of other ratifying countries. A spokesman for France's foreign ministry called the move ""bad news for the fight against climate change."" Japan's own environment minister, Goshi Hosono, urged Canada to stay in the protocol. Some countries, including India, were worried that Canada's decision might jeopardise future conferences. A spokesperson for the island nation of Tuvalu, significantly threatened by rising sea levels, accused Canada of an ""act of sabotage"" against his country. Australian government minister Greg Combet, however, defended the decision, saying that it did not mean Canada would not continue to ""play its part in global efforts to tackle climate change"". China called Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol ""regrettable"" and said that it went against the efforts of the international community. Canada's move came days after climate-change negotiators met to hammer-out a global deal in Durban, South Africa. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin expressed China's dismay at the news that Canada had pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol. Noting that the timing was particularly bad, because negotiators at the just-concluded Durban conference made what he described as important progress on the issue of the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period. The UK's Guardian newspaper reported on Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto treaty. According to the Guardian, ""Canada's inaction was blamed by some on its desire to protect the lucrative but highly polluting exploitation of tar sands, the second biggest oil reserve in the world."" Europe. European Union. On 31 May 2002, all fifteen then-members of the European Union deposited the relevant ratification paperwork at the UN. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 15 member countries which were Member States of the EU when the Protocol was agreed (EU-15) are committed to reducing their collective GHG emissions in the period 2008–12 to 8% below levels in 1990 (EEA, 2009, p. 9). All but one EU Member State (Austria) anticipate that they will meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (EEA, 2009, pp. 11–12). Denmark has committed itself to reducing its emissions by 21%. On 10 January 2007, the European Commission announced plans for a European Union energy policy that included a unilateral 20% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020. The EU has consistently been one of the major nominal supporters of the Kyoto Protocol, negotiating hard to get wavering countries on board. In December 2002, the EU created an emissions trading system (EU ETS) in an effort to meet these tough targets. Quotas were introduced in six key industries: energy, steel, cement, glass, brick making, and paper/cardboard. There are also fines for member nations that fail to meet their obligations, starting at €40/ton of carbon dioxide in 2005, and rising to €100/ton in 2008. The position of the EU is not without controversy in Protocol negotiations, however. One criticism is that, rather than reducing 8%, all the EU member countries should cut 15% as the EU insisted a uniform target of 15% for other developed countries during the negotiation while allowing itself to share a big reduction in the former East Germany to meet the 15% goal for the entire EU. According to Aldy ""et al"". (2003, p. 7), the ""hot air"" in German and UK targets allows the EU to meet its Kyoto target at low cost. Both the EU (as the European Community) and its member states are signatories to the Kyoto treaty. Greece, however was excluded from the Kyoto Protocol on Earth Day (22 April 2008) due to unfulfilled commitment of creating the adequate mechanisms of monitoring and reporting emissions, which is the minimum obligation, and delivering false reports by having no other data to report. A United Nations committee has decided to reinstate Greece in the emissions-trading system of the Kyoto Protocol after a seven-month suspension (on 15 November). Emissions In 2005, the EU-27 made up 11% of total global GHG emissionsa (MNP, 2007). Per capita emissionsa were 10.6 tons per capita. Transport CO2 emissions in the EU grew by 32% between 1990 and 2004. The share of transport in CO2 emissions was 21% in 1990, but by 2004 this had grown to 28%. Current EU projections suggest that by 2008 the EU will be at 4.7% below 1990 levels. France. France's Kyoto commitment is to cap its emissions at their 1990 levels (Stern, 2007, p. 456). The country has a national objective to reduce emissions by 25% from their 1990 levels by 2020, and a long-term target to reduce emissions 75–80% by 2050. In 2002, France's total GHG emissions were roughly equivalent to 1990 levels, and 6.4% below 1990 levels when accounting for sink enhancements, as allowed under the Protocol (IEA, 2004, p. 58). In 2001, France's per capita emissions were 6.32 tCO2 per capita. Only five other IEA countries had lower levels (p. 59). France's CO2 intensity of GDP (energy-related CO2 emissions per gross domestic production (GDP)) was the fifth-lowest among all IEA countries. In 2004, France shut down its last coal mine, and now gets 80% of its electricity from nuclear power and therefore has relatively low CO2 emissions, except for its transport sector. Germany. Germany has taken on a target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its GHG emissions by 21% compared with the base year 1990 (and in some cases, 1995) (IEA, 2007, pp. 44–45). Through 2004, Germany reduced its total GHG emissions by 17.4% (p. 45). Including the effects of land-use change increases this to 18.5%. The two main approaches Germany has used to meet its Kyoto target are reductions from the EU ETS, and reductions from the transport, household, and small business sectors (p. 51). Germany's progress towards its Kyoto target benefits from its reunification in 1990 (Liverman, 2008, p. 12). This is because of the reduction in emissions of East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. CO2 emissions in Germany fell 12% between 1990 and 1995 (Barrett, 1998, p. 34). Germany reduced gas emissions by 22.4% between 1990 and 2008. On 28 June 2006, the German government announced that it would exempt its coal industry from requirements under the E.U. internal emission trading system. Claudia Kemfert, an energy professor at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin said, ""For all its support for a clean environment and the Kyoto Protocol, the cabinet decision is very disappointing. The energy lobbies have played a big role in this decision."" However, Germany's voluntary commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 21% from the level in 1990 has practically been met, because emission has already been reduced by 19%. Germany is thus contributing 75% of the 8% reduction promised by the E.U. United Kingdom. According to the UK government, projections indicate that the UK's GHG emissions will fall about 23% below base year levels by 2010 (DECC, 2009, p. 3). The UK's Kyoto target of a 12.5% reduction in emissions on their 1990 level (Stern, 2007, p. 456) benefits from the country's relatively high emissions in that year (1990) (Liverman, 2008, p. 12). Compared to their 1990 level, UK CO2 emissions in 1995 were lower by 7%. This was despite the fact that the UK had not adopted a radical policy to reduce emissions (Barrett, 1998, p. 34). Since 1990, the UK has privatized its energy-consuming industries, which has helped to increase their energy efficiency (US Senate, 2005, p. 218). The UK has also liberalized its electricity and gas systems, resulting in a change from coal to gas (the ""dash for gas""), which has lowered emissions. It is estimated that these changes have contributed about half of the total observed reductions in UK CO2 emissions. The energy policy of the United Kingdom fully endorses goals for carbon dioxide emissions reduction and has committed to proportionate reduction in national emissions on a phased basis. The U.K. is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. On 13 March 2007, a draft Climate Change Bill was published after cross-party pressure over several years, led by environmental groups. Informed by the Energy White Paper 2003, the bill aims to achieve a mandatory reduction of 60% in the carbon emission from the 1990 level by 2050, with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020. On 26 November 2008, the Climate Change Act became law with a target of 80% reduction over 1990. The U.K. is the first country to ratify a law with such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target. The U.K. currently appears on course to meet its Kyoto limitation for the basket of greenhouse gases, assuming the government is able to curb CO? emissions between 2007 and 2008 to 2012. Although the overall greenhouse gas emissions in the U.K. have fallen, annual net carbon dioxide emission has increased by about 2% since the Labour Party came to power in 1997. As a result, it now seems highly unlikely that the government will be able to honor its pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20% from the 1990 level by 2010, unless an immediate and drastic action is taken under after the ratification of the Climate Change Bill. Norway. Norway's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol is to restrict its increase of GHGs to 1% above the 1990 level by the commitment period 2008–2012 (IEA, 2005, p. 46). In 2003, total emissions were 9% above the 1990 level. 99% of Norway's electricity from CO2-free hydropower. Oil and gas extraction activities contributed 74% to the total increase of CO2 in the period 1990–2003. The Norwegian government (2009, p. 11) projected a rise in GHG emissions of 15% from 1990 to 2010. Measures and policies adopted after autumn 2008 are not included in the baseline scenario (i.e., the predicted emissions that would occur without additional policy measures) for this projection (p. 55). Between 1990 and 2007, Norway's greenhouse gas emissions increased by 12%. As well as directly reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions, Norway's idea for carbon neutrality is to finance reforestation in China, a legal provision of the Kyoto protocol. Japan. Japan ratified the Kyoto Protocol in June 2002, and has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 6% below their 1990 levels (IEA, 2008, p. 47). Estimates for 2005 showed that Japan's emissions were 7.8% higher than in the base year. To meet its Kyoto target, the government aims for a 0.6% reduction in domestic GHG emissions compared with the base year. It also aims to meet part of its target through a forest sink of 13 million tonnes of carbon, which is equivalent to a 3.8% cut. Another reduction of 1.6% is aimed for using the Kyoto flexible mechanisms. According to IEA (2008, p. 45), Japan is a world leader in the field of sustainable energy policies. The legislation guiding Japan's efforts to reduce emissions is the Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan, passed in 2005 and later amended (p. 47). This Plan includes about 60 policies and measures. Most of these policies and measures are related to improved energy efficiency. When measured using market exchange rates, Japan's energy intensity in terms of total primary energy supply per unit of GDP is the lowest among IEA countries (p. 53). Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, its energy intensity is one of the lowest. Emissions In 2005, Japan's energy-related CO2 per capita emissions were 9.5 metric tons per head of population (World Bank, 2010, p. 362). Japan's total energy-related CO2 emissions made up 4.57% of global emissions in this year. Over the period 1850–2005, Japan's cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions were 46.1 billion metric tons. New Zealand. New Zealand signed the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC on 22 May 1998 and ratified it on 19 December 2002. New Zealand's target is to limit net greenhouse gas emissions for the five-year 2008-2012 commitment period to five times the 1990 gross volume of GHG emissions. New Zealand may meet this target by either reducing emissions or by obtaining carbon credits from the international market or from domestic carbon sinks. The credits may be any of the Kyoto units; Assigned amount units (AAU), removal units (RMU), Emission Reduction Units (ERU) and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In April 2012, the projection of New Zealand's net Kyoto position was a surplus of 23.1 million emissions units valued at NZ$189 million, based on an international carbon price of 5.03 Euro per tonne. On 9 November 2012, the New Zealand Government announced it would make climate pledges for the period from 2013 to 2020 under the UNFCCC process instead of adopting a binding limit under a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. At the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference New Zealand was awarded two 'Fossil of the Day' awards for ""actively hampering international progress"". The New Zealand Youth Delegation heavily criticised the New Zealand government, saying New Zealand's decision not to sign up for a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol was ""embarrassing, short-sighted and irresponsible"". Russia. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Russian Federation committed itself to keeping its GHG emissions at the base year level during the first Kyoto commitment period from 2008–2012 (UNFCCC, 2009, p. 3). UNFCCC (2009, p. 11) reported that Russian GHG emissions were projected to decline by 28% relative to base year level by 2010. The process of economic transition in the Russian Federation was accompanied by a sharp decline in its GDP in the 1990s (p. 4). Since 1998, the Russian Federation has experienced strong economic growth. In the period 1990–2006, emissions decreased by 33%. The difference between GDP and emissions was mainly driven by: Russia accounts for about two-thirds of the expected emission savings from Joint Implementation (JI) projects by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 21). These savings are projected to amount to 190 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) over the 2008–2012 period (p. 23). Politics Vladimir Putin approved the treaty on 4 November 2004, and Russia officially notified the United Nations of its ratification on 18 November 2004. The issue of Russian ratification was particularly closely watched in the international community, as the accord was brought into force 90 days after Russian ratification (16 February 2005). President Putin had earlier decided in favor of the protocol in September 2004, along with the Russian cabinet, against the opinion of the Russian Academy of Sciences, of the Ministry for Industry and Energy, and of the then-president's economic adviser, Andrey Illarionov, and in exchange for the EU's support for Russia's admission into the WTO. As anticipated, after this, ratification by the lower (22 October 2004) and upper house of parliament did not encounter any obstacles. There is an ongoing scientific debate on whether Russia will actually gain from selling credits for unused AAUs. United States. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol (IEA, 2007, p. 90). Doing so would have committed it to reduce GHG emissions by 7% below 1990 levels by 2012. Emissions of GHGs in the US increased by 16% between 1990 and 2005 (IEA, 2007, p. 83). In this period, the most substantial increase in volume were emissions from energy use, followed by industrial processes. In 2002, the US government set a goal to reduce the GHG emissions of the US economy per unit of economic output (the emissions intensity of the economy) (IEA, 2007, p. 87). The set goal is to reduce the GHG intensity of the US economy by 18% by 2012. To achieve this, policy has focused on supporting energy research and development, including support for carbon capture and storage (CCS), renewables, methane capture and use, and nuclear power. The America's Climate Security Act of 2007, also more commonly referred to in the U.S. as the ""Cap and Trade Bill"", was proposed for greater U.S. alignment with the Kyoto standards and goals. Emissions. Between 2001–2007, growth in US CO2 emissions was only 3%, comparable with to that of IEA Europe, and lower than that of a number of other countries, some of which are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (IEA, 2007, p. 90). In 2005, the US made up 16% of global GHG emissions,a and had per capita emissions of 24.1 tons of GHG per capita (MNP, 2007). Politics. The United States (U.S.), although a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, has neither ratified nor withdrawn from the Protocol. The signature alone is merely symbolic, as the Kyoto Protocol is non-binding on the United States unless ratified. Clinton administration. On 25 July 1997, before the Kyoto Protocol was finalized (although it had been fully negotiated, and a penultimate draft was finished), the U.S. Senate unanimously passed by a 95–0 vote the Byrd–Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which stated the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing nations as well as industrialized nations or ""would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States"". On 12 November 1998, Vice President Al Gore symbolically signed the protocol. Both Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman indicated that the protocol would not be acted upon in the Senate until there was participation by the developing nations. The Clinton Administration never submitted the protocol to the Senate for ratification. The Clinton Administration released an economic analysis in July 1998, prepared by the Council of Economic Advisors, which concluded that with emissions trading among the annex B/annex I countries, and participation of key developing countries in the ""Clean Development Mechanism""—which grants the latter business-as-usual emissions rates through 2012—the costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol could be reduced as much as 60% from many estimates. Estimates of the cost of achieving the Kyoto Protocol carbon reduction targets in the United States, as compared by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted losses to GDP of between 1.0% and 4.2% by 2010, reducing to between 0.5% and 2.0% by 2020. Some of these estimates assumed that action had been taken by 1998, and would be increased by delays in starting action. Bush administration. Under the Presidency of George W. Bush, the US government recognized climate change as a serious environmental challenge (IEA, 2007, p. 87). The policy of the Bush administration was to reduce the GHG emissions of the US economy per unit of economic output (the emissions intensity of the economy). This policy allowed for absolute increases in emissions. The Bush administration viewed a policy to reduce absolute emissions as incompatible with continued economic growth. A number of states set state-level GHG targets, despite the absence of a federal level target. President George W. Bush did not submit the treaty for Senate ratification based on the exemption granted to China (now the world's largest gross emitter of carbon dioxide, although emission is low per capita). Bush opposed the treaty because of the strain he believed the treaty would put on the economy; he emphasized the uncertainties which he believed were present in the scientific evidence. Furthermore, the U.S. was concerned with broader exemptions of the treaty. For example, the U.S. did not support the split between annex I countries and others. In June 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency released the ""Climate Action Report 2002"". Some observers have interpreted this report as being supportive of the protocol, although the report itself does not explicitly endorse the protocol. At the G8 meeting in June 2005 administration officials expressed a desire for ""practical commitments industrialized countries can meet without damaging their economies"". According to those same officials, the United States is on track to fulfill its pledge to reduce its carbon intensity 18% by 2012. In 2002, the U.S. National Environmental trust labelled carbon intensity, ""a bookkeeping trick which allows the administration to do nothing about global warming while unsafe levels of emissions continue to rise."" The United States has signed the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, a pact that allows those countries to set their goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions individually, but with no enforcement mechanism. Supporters of the pact see it as complementing the Kyoto Protocol while being more flexible. The Administration's position was not uniformly accepted in the U.S. For example, economist Paul Krugman noted that the target 18% reduction in carbon intensity is still actually an increase in overall emissions. The White House has also come under criticism for downplaying reports that link human activity and greenhouse gas emissions to climate change and that a White House official, former oil industry advocate and current Exxon Mobil officer, Philip Cooney, watered down descriptions of climate research that had already been approved by government scientists, charges the White House denies. Critics point to the Bush administration's close ties to the oil and gas industries. In June 2005, State Department papers showed the administration thanking Exxon executives for the company's ""active involvement"" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the U.S. stance on Kyoto. Input from the business lobby group Global Climate Coalition was also a factor. In 2002, Congressional researchers who examined the legal status of the Protocol advised that signature of the UNFCCC imposes an obligation to refrain from undermining the Protocol's object and purpose, and that while the President probably cannot implement the Protocol alone, Congress can create compatible laws on its own initiative. Obama administration. President Barack Obama has not yet taken any action with the senate that would change the position of the United States towards this protocol. When Obama was in Turkey in April 2009, he said that ""it doesn't make sense for the United States to sign Kyoto Protocol because is about to end"". At this time, two years and eleven months remained from the four-year commitment period. States and local governments. The Framework Convention on Climate Change is a treaty negotiated between countries at the UN; thus individual states are not free to participate independently within this Protocol to the treaty. Nonetheless, several separate initiatives have started at the level of state or city. Eight Northeastern U.S. states created the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a state level emissions capping and trading program, using their own independently-developed mechanisms. Their first allowances were auctioned in November 2008. On 27 September 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law the bill AB 32, also known as the Global Warming Solutions Act, establishing a timetable to reduce the state's greenhouse-gas emissions, which rank at 12th-largest in the world, by 25% by the year 2020. This law effectively puts California in line with the Kyoto limitations, but at a date later than the 2008–2012 Kyoto commitment period. Many of the features of the Californian system are similar to the Kyoto mechanisms, although the scope and targets are different. The parties in the Western Climate Initiative expect to be compatible with some or all of the Californian model. As of 14 June 2009, 944 U.S. cities in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, representing over 80 million Americans support Kyoto after Mayor Greg Nickels of Seattle started a nationwide effort to get cities to agree to the protocol. On 29 October 2007, it was reported that Seattle met their target reduction in 2005, reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent since 1990. Non-Annex I. UNFCCC (2005) compiled and synthesized information reported to it by non-Annex I Parties. Most reporting non-Annex I Parties belonged in the low-income group, with very few classified as middle-income (p. 4). Most Parties included information on policies relating to sustainable development. Sustainable development priorities mentioned by non-Annex I Parties included poverty alleviation and access to basic education and health care (p. 6). Many non-Annex I Parties are making efforts to amend and update their environmental legislation to include global concerns such as climate change (p. 7). A few Parties, e.g., South Africa and Iran, stated their concern over how efforts to reduce emissions could affect their economies. The economies of these countries are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing, and export of fossil fuels. Emissions GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7 billion tonnes (billion = 1,000,000,000) of CO2-eq. CO2 was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by methane (26%) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (11%). The energy sector was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO2-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8 tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties. Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9 billion tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7 billion tonnes. Brazil. Brazil has a national objective to increase the share of alternative renewable energy sources (biomass, wind and small hydropower) to 10% by 2030. It also has programmes to protect public forests from deforestation (Stern, 2007, p. 456). People's Republic of China. China has a number of domestic policy measures that affect its GHG emissions (Jones ""et al."", 2008, p. 26). These include a target to reduce the energy intensity of their GDP by 20% during the 2005–10 period. China plans to expand renewable energy generation to 15% of total capacity by 2020 (Wang ""et al."", p. 86). Other policies include (Jones ""et al."", 2008, p. 26): From 1995–2004, China energy efficiency efforts reduced its energy intensity by 30% (Wang ""et al."", 2010, p. 87). From 2006–09, China achieved a 14.4% reduction in energy intensity. Renewables account for 8% of China's energy and 17% of its electricity. In response to the financial crisis, China implemented one of the world's largest stimulus's in efficient and clean energy (p. 85). Emissions In 2005, China made up 17% of global GHG emissions,a with per capita emissions of 5.8 tons of GHG per head (MNP, 2007). Another way of measuring GHG emissions is to measure the cumulative emissions that a country has emitted over time (IEA, 2007b, p. 199). Over a long time period, cumulative emissions provide an indication of a country's total contribution to GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Measured over the time period 1900–2005, China's cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions made up 8% of the global total (IEA, 2007b, p. 201). Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A report by the Carbon Trust (2009) assessed the use of CDM in China. The CDM has been used to finance projects in China for renewable energy and HFC-23 reductions (HFC's are powerful greenhouse gases). For renewables, the CDM was judged to have helped to stimulate wind and small hydro power projects. Critics have argued that these policies would generally have taken place without the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 56). India. India signed and ratified the Protocol in August, 2002. Since India is exempted from the framework of the treaty, it is expected to gain from the protocol in terms of transfer of technology and related foreign investments. At the G8 meeting in June 2005, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pointed out that the per-capita emission rates of the developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibility"", India maintains that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time. However, the U.S. and other Western nations assert that India, along with China, will account for most of the emissions in the coming decades, owing to their rapid industrialization and economic growth. Policies in India related to greenhouse gas emissions have included (Stern, 2007, p. 456; Jones ""et al."", 2008, p. 26): Emissions In 2005, India accounted for 5% of global GHG emissions,a with per capita emissions of 2.1 tons of GHG per head of population (MNP, 2007). Over the time period 1900–2005, India's contribution to the global total of cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions was 2% (IEA, 2007b, p.&nbsp201). Pakistan. Although the Minister of State for environment Malik Min Aslam was at first not very receptive, he subsequently convinced the Shoukat Aziz cabinet to ratify the Protocol. The decision was taken in 2001 but due to international circumstances, it was announced in Argentina in 2004 and accepted in 2005, opening the way for the creation of a policy framework. On 11 January 2005, Pakistan submitted its instruments of accession to the Kyoto Protocol. The Ministry of Environment assigned the task to work as designated national authority (DNA). According to a news story by Khan (2009), it was expected that the Protocol would help Pakistan lower dependence on fossil fuels through renewable energy projects. Pakistan had a per capita income of US$ 492 in 2002–2003, and is a low-income country (Pakistan government, 2003, p. 15). The Pakistan government is concentrating on reducing the vulnerability of the country to current climatic events (p. 17). CDM In February, 2006, the national CDM operational strategy was approved, and on 27 April 2006, the first CDM project was approved by DNA. It was reduction of large N2O from nitric acid production (investor: Mitsubishi, Japan), with an estimated annual production of 1 million CERs. Finally, in November, 2006, the first CDM project was registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Pakistan has specified preferences for the CDM projects, including (Pakistan government, 2006, pp. 3–4): So far, 23 CDM so far have been approved by the Pakistan government (n.d.). Emissions Over the period from July 1993 to June 1994, Pakistan's energy sector was by far the highest contributor to CO2 emissions, with a share of 81% of total CO2 emissions (Pakistan government, 2003, pp. 16). Pakistan's energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 94.1% between 1990 and 2005 (World Bank, 2010, p. 362). Pakistan's per capita emissions in 2005 were 0.8 tCO2 per head (p. 362). In 2005, Pakistan contributed 0.45% of the global total in energy-related CO2 emissions. Pakistan's cumulative emissions over the period 1850–2005 was 2.4 billion metric tons. Cumulative emissions before 1971 are based on data for East and West Pakistan. Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. The Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate (APP) is a US-led effort to accelerate the voluntary development and deployment of clean energy technologies (UNEP, 2007, p. 257). The purpose of the Partnership is to address the issues of energy security, air pollution, and climate change (IEA, 2007, p. 51). The partner countries are Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea, and the United States (APP, n.d., p. 1). According to the APP (n.d.), the APP contributes to Partners' efforts under the UNFCCC, while ""complementing"" the Kyoto Protocol. Footnotes. a Estimates by MNP (2007) are for the GHG emissions from fossil fuel use and cement production. Calculations are for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluor containing gases (the F-gases HFCs, PFCs and SF6). These estimates are subject to large uncertainties regarding CO2 emissions from deforestation; and the per country emissions of other GHGs (e.g., methane). There are also other large uncertainties which mean that small differences between countries are not significant. CO2 emissions from the decay of remaining biomass after biomass burning/deforestation are not included. "
350.org," 350.org  350.org is an international environmental organization, founded by author Bill McKibben, with the goal of building a global grassroots movement to raise awareness about anthropogenic climate change, to confront climate change denial, and to cut emissions of carbon dioxide in order to slow the rate of global warming. 350.org takes its name from the research of Goddard Institute for Space Studies scientist James E. Hansen, who posited in a 2007 paper that 350 parts-per-million (ppm) of CO2 in the atmosphere is a safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point. Origins. The organization was founded by author Bill McKibben and a group of students from Middlebury College. McKibben is an American environmentalist and writer who wrote one of the first books on global warming for the general public, and frequently writes about climate change, alternative energy, and the need for more localized economies.  The organizing effort drew its name from NASA climate scientist James Hansen's contention that any atmospheric concentration of CO2 above 350 parts per million was unsafe. James Hansen opined that ""if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that."" Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, rose by 2.3 parts per million to 389 ppm in 2010 from the previous year, and continued to increase with January 2012 atmospheric CO2 concentration at 393.09 and crossed 400 ppm on monitors in May 2012 in the industrialized Northern Hemisphere's Arctic region. McKibben first started to organize against climate change with a walk across Vermont, his home state. His ""Step It Up"" campaign in 2007 involved 1,400 demonstrations at famous sites across the United States. McKibben credits these activities with making Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama change their energy policies during the presidential campaign. Starting in 2008, 350.org built upon the ""Step It Up"" campaign and made it into a global organization. Rajendra Pachauri, the U.N.'s ""top climate scientist"" and leader of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has come out, as have others, in favor of reducing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide to 350 ppm. McKibben called news of Pachauri's embrace of the 350ppm target ""amazing"". Some media have indicated that Pachauri's endorsement of the 350 ppm target was a victory for 350.org's activism. The organization had a lift in prominence after McKibben appeared on The Colbert Report television show on Monday August 17, 2009. McKibben promotes the organization on speaking tours and by writing articles about it for many major newspapers and media, such as the Los Angeles Times and The Guardian. The organization disseminates its message through social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. In 2012 the organization was presented with the 2012 Katerva Award for Behavioural Change. Goals. The 350.org movement is treating the 350ppm cap of carbon dioxide as a safe upper limit of what can be released into the atmosphere, and using that number as a rallying cry for a 2009 COP15 international treaty. One overall goal is to influence governments to adopt policies that would lower carbon dioxide emissions. 350.org aims to build a global, grassroots movement to take on the fossil fuel industry and solve the climate crisis. Through online campaigns, grassroots organizing, and mass public actions, 350.org has mobilized thousands of volunteer organizers in over 188 countries.  Climate safety and climate justice for people across the globe is a critical part of 350.org's mission. By working with local community groups, 350.org aims to hold corporations and world leaders accountable to the realities of science and the principles of social justice.  The Science of 350. 350 parts per million is what scientists, climate experts, and progressive national governments are now saying is the safe upper limit for CO2 in our atmosphere. In May 2013, two independent teams of scientists measuring CO2 near the summit of Mauna Loa in Hawaii recorded that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million, probably for the first time in more than 3 million years of Earth history. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is continuing to rise at about 2ppm every year.  2 degrees Celsius, or about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, was agreed upon during the 2009 Copenhagen Accord as a limit for global temperature rise. The accord formally recognized ""the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below two degrees Celsius."" The next paragraph declared that ""we agree that deep cuts in global emissions are required... so as to hold the increase in global temperature below two degrees Celsius."" In order to stay below a 2 degree increase, scientists have estimated that humans can pour roughly 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. At present emission rates, (31 gigatons globally in 2011 and rising) 565 gigatons will be reached by 2028. Fossil-fuel companies currently have about 2,795 gigatons of carbon already contained in their proven coal and oil and gas reserves, and is the amount of fossil fuels they are currently planning to burn. 2,795 gigatons is five times higher than the limit of 565 gigatons that would keep Earth under a global temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius. Campaigns and Projects. Keystone XL pipeline. 350.org has named the Keystone XL pipeline as a critical issue and turning point for the environmental movement, as well as for President Obama's legacy. NASA climatologist James Hansen labeled the Keystone XL pipeline as ""game over"" for the planet, and called the amount of carbon stored in Canadian tar sands a ""fuse to the largest carbon bomb on the planet.""  350.org cites oil spills along the proposed pipeline route, which would pass near Texas' Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to more than 12 million people. It could also pose danger to the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest aquifer in western North America that supplies drinking water and irrigation to millions of people and agricultural businesses. 350.org has opposed the economic argument that has been made by proponents of the pipeline, arguing that Keystone XL would create only a few thousand temporary jobs during construction. The State Department estimated that ultimately the pipeline will create 35 permanent jobs. Contrary to oil industry claims, the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has said that the Keystone XL pipeline will increase gas prices instead of lowering them. The NRDC's study also refutes the claim that the pipeline will lead to energy independence, because the pipeline will carry tar sands from Canada to Texas which will then be sold on the global market. Fossil Fuel Divestment. 350.org launched their Go Fossil Free: Divest from Fossil Fuels! campaign in 2012 with Bill McKibben's ""Do The Math"" speaking tour around the country. The campaign calls for colleges and universities, as well as cities, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: ""If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage."" 350.org states their demand as the following ""We want institutions to immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies, and divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within 5 years."" There are currently fossil fuel divestment campaigns at 308 colleges and universities, 105 cities and states, and 6 religious institutions. As of July 2013, six colleges and universities (San Francisco State University, Hampshire, College, Unity College, Sterling College, College of the Atlantic, and Green Mountain College) have committed to fossil fuel divestment. Seventeen cities (Seattle, WA; San Francisco, CA; Portland, OR; Eugene, OR; Berkeley, CA; Richmond, CA; Santa Monica, CA; Boulder, CO; Santa Fe, NM; Madison, WI; Bayfield, WI; State College, PA; Ithaca, NY; Truro, MA; Provincetown, MA; Providence, RI; and Cambridge, MA) have made commitments to divest. Twelve religious institutions (United Church of Christ – National, Massachusetts United Church of Christ, Minnesota United Church of Christ, Evangelical Lutheran Church of Oregon, First Unitarian Church of Salt Lake City, First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Cambridge, MA, Portsmouth South Church Unitarian, First Unitarian Church of Pittsfield, ME, First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee, Uniting Church, New South Wales & ACT, Australia, Dover Friends Meeting, Dover, NH, Melbourne Unitarian Church, Australia) have also committed to fossil fuel divestment. Do The Math: The Movie. The Do The Math movie is a 42-minute documentary film about the rising movement to change the terrifying math of the climate crisis and challenge the fossil fuel industry.  Global Power Shift. Phase 1 of Global Power Shift was a convergence in Istanbul, Turkey in June 2013 of about five-hundred climate organizers from 135 countries. Stated objectives include sharing and developing skills to organize movements, building upon existing plans to organize in-country Power Shift events after the kickoff event in Turkey, building political alignment and a clear theory of change, sharing experiences from different countries, formulating strategies to overcome challenges, and building relationships to strengthen regional and international cooperation and collaboration. Phase 2 of Global Power Shift involves the organizers who were in Turkey in June 2013 to bring home what they learned to organize summits, events, and mobilizations. Summer Heat. 350.org launched the Summer Heat campaign in the Summer of 2013, and was a wave of mass mobilizations across the country. Summer Heat actions took place at eleven locations: Richmond, CA; Vancouver, WA; Green River, UT; Albuquerque, NM; Houston, TX; St. Ignace, MI; Warren, OH; Washington, D.C.; Camp David, MD; Somerset, MA; and Sebago Lake, ME. Participants included grassroots organizers, labor unions, farmers, ranchers, environmental justice groups, and others. The slogan that was used for the Summer Heat campaign was: ""As The Temperature Rises, So Do We."" Activities. International Day of Climate Action. An ""International Day of Climate Action"" on October 24, 2009, was organized by 350.org to influence the delegates going to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in December, 2009 (COP15). This was the first global campaign ever organized around a scientific data point. The actions organised by 350.org included gigantic depictions of the number ""350"", walks, marches, rallies, teach-ins, bike rides, sing-a-thons, carbon-free dinners, retrofitting houses to save energy, tree plantings, mass dives at the Great Barrier Reef, solar-cooked bake-outs, churches bell ringings, underwater cabinet meetings (Maldives), and armband distributions to athletes. The organization reported that over 5,200 synchronized demonstrations occurred in 181 countries on the day. The group reports that they organised the world's ""most widespread day of political action"" on Saturday October 24, 2009, reporting 5,245 actions in 181 countries. 10/10/10 Global Work Party. As a follow-up to 2009's International Day of Climate Action, 350.org and the campaign joined to help coordinate another global day of action which occurred on October 10, 2010. The 2010 campaign is focused on concrete actions that can be taken locally to help combat climate change. Actions from tree-plantings to solar panel installations to huge electricity service-provider switching parties occurred in almost every country around the world. Connect the Dots 5.May.2012. The organization's efforts continued into 2012 with a planned May 5 worldwide series of rallies under the slogan “Connect the Dots,” to draw attention to the links between climate change and extreme weather. Per the 350.org website the day is called Climate Impacts Day. General activities. Apart from special events, 350.org organizes actions on an ongoing basis to promote its message. These activities include tree plantings (350 trees in each instance) for biosequestration, promoting the term ""350"", publishing adverts in major newspapers calling for the target level of carbon dioxide to be lowered to 350ppm, conducting polls on the subject of climate change, educating youth leaders, lobbying governments on the issue of carbon targets, and joining a campaign to establish a .eco top-level domain or ""tld"". In December 2009, the group petitioned the United States Environmental Protection Agency to set national limits for greenhouse gases using the Clean Air Act, asking the agency to cap atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide at 350 parts per million. The organization created and distributed a time-lapse video showing the recent retreat of Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska, graphically depicting the impacts of warming climates. On President's Day, February 18, 2013, it is co-organizing a national day of action to call on President Obama to address climate change. Membership. 350.org claims alliance with 300 organizations around the world and has enlisted ""350 messengers"" who have publicly allied themselves with the organization or its goal to spread the 350 movement, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Steffen, Bianca Jagger, David Suzuki, and Colin Beavan. 1Sky merged into 350.org in 2011. Criticism. In a New York Times article climate scientist Gavin Schmidt questions whether it is meaningful to raise awareness by promoting a certain goal number for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He later on clarifies on the RealClimate blog that his statement was not meant as a criticism of the movement itself. "
Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States," Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States  The United States was the largest emitter of carbon dioxide emissions until 2006 when China overtook it. The United States' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 2012 projections for 2030 by the Department of Energy have dropped 28 percent from its 2007 projections regarding the U.S. energy industry, due to the recession and the hydraulic fracturing boom (natural gas) that has reduced the release of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. While the Bush administration opted against Kyoto-type policies, the Obama administration and various state, local, and regional governments have attempted to adopt some Kyoto Protocol goals on a local basis. For example, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), is a state-level emissions capping and trading program, which was founded on January 18, 2007, by eight northeastern U.S. states. The White House announced on 2009-11-25 that President Obama is offering a U.S. target for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. The U.S. State Department offered a nation-level perspective in the Fourth US Climate Action Report (USCAR) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including measures to address climate change. The report shows that the country is on track to achieve President Bush's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity (the amount of GHG emissions per unit of gross domestic product) by 18 percent from 2002 to 2012. Over that same period, actual GHG emissions are projected to increase by 11 percent. The report estimates that in 2006, U.S. GHG emissions decreased 1.5 percent from 2005 to 7,075.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This represents an increase of 15.1 percent from the 1990 levels of 6,146.7 million tonnes (or 0.9 percent annual increase), and an increase of 1.4 percent from the 2000 levels of 6,978.4 million tonnes. By 2012 GHG emissions are projected to increase to more than 7,709 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which will be 26 percent above 1990 levels. 2007. U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy use rose by 1.6% in 2007, according to preliminary estimates by the United States Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Electricity generation increased by 2.5%, and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector increased even more, at 3%, indicating that U.S. utilities shifted towards energy sources that emitted more carbon. That shift was partially caused by a 40 billion kilowatt-hour decrease in hydropower production causing a greater reliance on fossil fuels like natural gas and coal. Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants fueled with natural gas increased by 10.5%, while coal-burning power plants increased their emissions by 1.8%.  In 2007 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stated that the ""U.S. and global annual temperatures are now approximately 1.0°F warmer than at the start of the 20th century, and the rate of warming has accelerated over the past 30 years, increasing globally since the mid-1970's at a rate approximately three times faster than the century-scale trend. The past nine years have all been among the 25 warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S., a streak which is unprecedented in the historical record."" Reduction target. The White House announced on 25 November 2009 that President Barack Obama is offering a U.S. target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. The proposed target agrees with the limit set by climate legislation that has passed the U.S. House of Representatives, but the U.S. Senate is currently considering a bill that cuts GHG emissions to 20% below 2005 levels by 2020. The White House noted that the final U.S. emissions target will ultimately fall in line with the climate legislation, once that legislation passes both houses of Congress and is approved by the President. In light of the president's goal for an 83% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, the pending legislation also includes a reduction in GHG emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2025 and to 42% below 2005 levels by 2030. Strategy and measures to address climate change. The U.S. strategy integrates actions to address climate change (including actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions) into a broader agenda that promotes energy security, pollution reduction, and sustainable economic development. Near-term measures. Transportation. As of 2011, 71% of petroleum consumed in the USA was used for transportation. Programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector: Criticism. The British climate envoy in the meeting of the world's top 16 polluters, John Ashton, said the United States seemed isolated on the issue of fighting climate change: Requirements to report greenhouse gas emissions. As a result of the USEPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, thousands of companies in the US, beginning January 1, 2010, are required to monitor their greenhouse gas emissions and begin reporting those emissions in 2011. A detailed inventory of fossil fuel emissions is provided by the Project Vulcan, produced by researchers at Purdue University. "
2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference," 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference  The 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Cancún, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010. The conference is officially referred to as the 16th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 6th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. In addition, the two permanent subsidiary bodies of the UNFCCC – the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)– held their 33rd sessions. The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference extended the mandates of the two temporary subsidiary bodies, the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA), and they met as well. Background. Following the non-binding Copenhagen Accord put forth in 2009, international expectations for the COP16 conference were reduced. Four preparatory rounds of negotiations (i.e. sessions of the AWG-KP and the AWG-LCA) were held during 2010. The first three of these were in Bonn, Germany, from 9 to 11 April, 1 to 11 June (in conjunction with the 32nd sessions of SBSTA and SBI), and 2 to 6 August. The Bonn talks were reported as ending in failure. The fourth round of talks in Tianjin, China, made minimal progress and was marked by a clash between the US and China. The Ambo declaration was adopted at the Tarawa Climate Change Conference on the 10th November 2010 by Australia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Fiji, Japan, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Tonga. It calls for more and immediate action, and was slated to be presented at COP 16. Expectations. In August 2010, Ban Ki-moon stated that he doubted whether member states would reach a ""globally agreed, comprehensive deal,"" suggesting instead that incremental steps might come. After the Tianjin talks in October Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said, """"This week has got us closer to a structured set of decisions that can be agreed in Cancun ... This is the greatest societal and economic transformation that the world has ever seen."""" Other commentators spoke of a positive spirit of negotiation and of paving the way for agreement in Cancun. Outcome. The outcome of the summit was an agreement adopted by the states' parties that called for a large ""Green Climate Fund"", and a ""Climate Technology Centre"" and network. It looked forward to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol. The agreement recognizes that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, which needs to be urgently addressed by all Parties. It affirms that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and that all Parties must share a vision for long-term cooperative action in order to achieve the objective of the Convention, including through achievement of a global goal. It recognizes that warming of the climate system is scientifically based and that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid twentieth century are very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, as assessed by the IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report. The agreement further recognizes that deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are required, with a view to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions so as to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and that Parties should take urgent action to meet this long-term goal, consistent with science and on the basis of equity; and recognizes the need to consider, in the context of the first review, strengthening in relation to a global average temperature rise of 1.5°C. The agreement also notes that addressing climate change requires a paradigm shift towards building a low-carbon society. The agreement calls on rich countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as pledged in the Copenhagen Accord, and for developing countries to plan to reduce their emissions. A 40-nation ""transition committee"" was to meet by the end of March 2011, but it was deferred until late April amid squabbles among Latin American countries and the Asia bloc about who should be on the committee. The committee is due to present a complete plan for the fund by the next climate conference in South Africa starting in November, 2011.  Adaptation. The conference established the Cancun Adaptation Framework and the Adaptation Committee, and it invited Parties to strengthen and, where necessary, establish regional adaptation centres and networks. Mitigation. Developed countries should submit annual greenhouse gas inventories and inventory reports and biennial reports on their progress. It Agrees that developing country Parties will take nationally appropriate mitigation actions in the context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, aimed at achieving a deviation in emissions relative to ""business as usual"" emissions in 2020. It decides to set up a registry to record Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions seeking international support and to facilitate matching of finance, technology and capacity-building support to these actions. Once support has been provided they are called internationally supported mitigation actions (ISMAs), that will be subject to international measurement, reporting and verification. Finance. It takes note of the collective commitment by developed countries to provide new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010–-2012 and recognizes that developed country Parties commit, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. It decides to establish a Green Climate Fund, to be designated as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention. Also decides that the Fund shall be governed by a board of 24 members; the trustee shall administer the assets of the Green Climate Fund only for the purpose of, and in accordance with, the relevant decisions of the Green Climate Fund Board. The conference establishes a Standing Committee under the Conference of the Parties to assist the Conference of the Parties in exercising its functions with respect to the financial mechanism Technology. In technology development and transfer, decides to establish a Technology Mechanism, which will consist of a Technology Executive Committee and a Climate Technology Centre and Network. The Climate Technology Centre and Network and the Technology Executive Committee shall relate so as to promote coherence and synergy. The Technology Executive Committee shall further implement the framework of the Convention (technology transfer framework) and Committee shall comprise 20 expert members. The Climate Technology Centre shall facilitate a Network of national, regional, sectoral and international technology networks, organizations and initiatives Capacity-building. It reaffirms that capacity-building is essential to enable developing country Parties to participate fully in addressing the climate change challenges, and to implement effectively their commitments under the Convention. Kyoto Protocol. The Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol at its fifteenth session: Reactions. The agreement includes a ""Green Climate Fund,"" proposed to be worth $100 billion a year by 2020, to assist poorer countries in financing emission reductions and adaptation. There was no agreement on how to extend the Kyoto Protocol, or how the $100 billion a year for the Green Climate Fund will be raised, or whether developing countries should have binding emissions reductions or whether rich countries would have to reduce emissions first. Reuters Environment Correspondent Alister Doyle reported that to most delegates, though they approved it, the agreement “fell woefully short of action needed.”  The ""New York Times"" described the agreement as being both a ""major step forward"" given that international negotiations had stumbled in recent years, and as being ""fairly modest"" as it did not require the changes that scientists say are needed to avoid dangerous climate change. John Vidal, writing in ""The Guardian"", criticised the Cancun agreements for not providing leadership, for not specifying how the proposed climate fund will be financed, and for not stating that countries had to ""peak"" their emissions within 10 years and then rapidly reduce them for there to be any chance to avert warming. Also criticised were the deferral of decisions on the legal form of and level of emission reductions required. Professor Kevin Anderson described the Cancun accord as ""astrology"" and stated that the science was suggesting a 4°C rise in global mean temperature, possibly as early as the 2060s. "
2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference," 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference  __NOTOC__ The 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference took place at the Bali International Conference Centre, Nusa Dua, in Bali, Indonesia, between December 3 and December 15, 2007 (though originally planned to end on 14 December). Representatives from over 180 countries attended, together with observers from intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations. The conference encompassed meetings of several bodies, including the 13th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 13), the 3rd Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP 3 or CMP 3), together with other subsidiary bodies and a meeting of ministers. Negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol dominated the conference. A meeting of environment ministers and experts held in June called on the conference to agree on a road-map, timetable and 'concrete steps for the negotiations' with a view to reaching an agreement by 2009. It has been debated whether this global meeting on climate change has achieved anything significant at all.  Initial EU proposals called for global emissions to peak in 10 to 15 years and decline ""well below half"" of the 2000 level by 2050 for developing countries and for developed countries to achieve emissions levels 20-40% below 1990 levels by 2020. The United States strongly opposed these numbers, at times backed by Japan, Canada, Australia and Russia. The resulting compromise mandates ""deep cuts in global emissions"" with references to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report. "
Angelina Jolie," Angelina Jolie  Angelina Jolie ( , born Angelina Jolie Voight; June 4, 1975) is an American actress, film director, screenwriter, and author. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and was named Hollywood's highest-paid actress by ""Forbes"" in 2009, 2011, and 2013. Jolie promotes humanitarian causes, and is noted for her work with refugees as a Special Envoy and former Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She has often been cited as the world's ""most beautiful"" woman, a title for which she has received substantial media attention. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in ""Lookin' to Get Out"" (1982), but her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production ""Cyborg 2"" (1993). Her first leading role in a major film was in the cyber-thriller ""Hackers"" (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical television films ""George Wallace"" (1997) and ""Gia"" (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999). Jolie achieved wide fame after her portrayal of the video game heroine Lara Croft in ' (2001), and established herself among the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood with the sequel ' (2003). She continued her action star career with ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (2005), ""Wanted"" (2008), ""Salt"" (2010) and ""The Tourist"" (2010)—her biggest live-action commercial successes to date with international revenues of US$478 million, $341 million, $293 million and $278 million respectively—and she received further critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas ""A Mighty Heart"" (2007) and ""Changeling"" (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie made her directorial debut with the wartime drama ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" (2011). Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, Jolie now lives with actor Brad Pitt, in a relationship notable for fervent media attention. Jolie and Pitt have three biological children and three adopted children. Early life and family. Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor, and goddaughter of actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell. On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent, and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry. Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois, although her only known Native American ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649. After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. As a child, Jolie often watched movies with her mother and explained this had inspired her interest in acting; she stated that she was not influenced by her father's career. When she was six years old, her mother and stepfather, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. She then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. At the age of 14, Jolie dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director. She began working as a fashion model, modeling mainly in Los Angeles, New York, and London. During this period, she wore black clothing, experimented with knife play, and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend. Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home. She graduated from high school and returned to theater studies, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos."" Jolie suffered episodes of suicidal depression throughout her teens and early twenties. She felt isolated at Beverly Hills High School among the children of some of the area's affluent families, as her mother survived on a more modest income, and she was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces. She found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she started to self-harm; later commenting, ""I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."" She also began experimenting with drugs; by the age of 20, she had tried ""just about every drug possible,"" including heroin. Jolie has had a difficult relationship with her father. Because of Voight's marital infidelity and the resulting breakup of her parents' marriage, she was estranged from her father for many years. They reconciled and he appeared with her in """" (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated. In July 2002, Jolie—who had long used her middle name as a stage name to establish her own identity as an actress—filed a request to legally drop Voight as her surname, which was granted on September 12, 2002. In August of that year, Voight claimed his daughter had ""serious mental problems"" on ""Access Hollywood"". In response, Jolie released a statement in which she indicated that she no longer wished to pursue a relationship with her father. She explained that because she had adopted her son Maddox, she did not think it was healthy for her to associate with Voight. In the wake of her mother's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, Jolie again reconciled with her father after a six-year estrangement. Career. Early work: 1982; 1991–1997. When she was seven years old, Jolie had a small part in ""Lookin' to Get Out"" (1982), a movie co-written by and starring her father, Jon Voight. She committed to acting at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that she was ""too dark."" She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991); Antonello Venditti's version of Crowded House's hit ""Don't Dream It's Over"", ""Alta Marea"" (1991); The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993); and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens."" Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the low-budget, straight-to-video science-fiction sequel ""Cyborg 2"", as Casella ""Cash"" Reese, a near-human robot, designed to seduce her way into a rival manufacturer's headquarters and then self-detonate. Jolie was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year. Following a supporting role in the independent film ""Without Evidence"" (1995), Jolie starred as Kate ""Acid Burn"" Libby in her first Hollywood picture, ""Hackers"" (1995). ""The New York Times"" wrote, ""Kate (Angelina Jolie) stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than co-stars and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. Despite her sullen posturing, which is all this role requires, Ms. Jolie has the sweetly cherubic looks of her father, Jon Voight."" The movie failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release. She next appeared in the 1996 comedy ""Love Is All There Is"", a modern-day loose adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in The Bronx, New York. In the road movie ""Mojave Moon"" (1996) she played a young woman who falls for Danny Aiello's middle-aged character, while he develops feelings for her mother, played by Anne Archer. That same year, Jolie also portrayed Margret ""Legs"" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film ""Foxfire"" after they beat up a teacher who has sexually harassed them. The ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote about her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."" In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller ""Playing God"", set in the Los Angeles underworld. The movie was not well received by critics; Roger Ebert noted that ""Angelina Jolie [...] finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be Blossom's girlfriend, and maybe she is."" She then appeared in the television film ""True Women"" (1997), a historical romantic drama set in the American West and based on the book by Janice Woods Windle. That year, she also appeared as a stripper in the music video for ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" by the Rolling Stones. Breakthrough: 1998–2000. Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's ""George Wallace"" (1997). She portrayed Cornelia Wallace, the second wife of Alabama Governor George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. The film was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance. In 1998, Jolie starred in HBO's ""Gia"", portraying supermodel Gia Carangi. The film chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance from Reel.com noted, ""Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."" For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award. In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting ""Gia"", she told her then-husband Jonny Lee Miller that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"" After ""Gia"" wrapped in 1997, Jolie announced that she had given up acting for good, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give."" She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she enrolled at New York University to study filmmaking and attend writing classes; she later described it as ""just good for me to collect myself."" Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for ""George Wallace"" and the positive critical reception of ""Gia"", she resumed her career. Jolie returned to film in the 1998 gangster movie ""Hell's Kitchen"". Later that year, she appeared in ""Playing by Heart"", part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillippe, and Jon Stewart. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular. The ""San Francisco Chronicle"" wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."" Jolie won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. In 1999, she starred in the comedy-drama ""Pushing Tin"", alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film received a mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized. ""The Washington Post"" wrote, ""Mary (Angelina Jolie) a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."" She then co-starred with Denzel Washington in ""The Bone Collector"" (1999), an adaptation of a crime novel by Jeffery Deaver. Jolie played a police officer haunted by her cop father's suicide, who reluctantly helps Washington track down a serial killer. The movie grossed $151 million worldwide, but was a critical failure. The ""Detroit Free Press"" concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast."" Jolie next took the supporting role of the sociopathic mental patient Lisa Rowe in ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999), an adaptation of author Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood. She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. ""Variety"" noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation."" In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", in which she played Sarah ""Sway"" Wayland, the ex-girlfriend of car thief Nicolas Cage. The role was small, and ""The Washington Post"" criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."" She later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after the emotionally heavy role of Lisa Rowe. It became her highest-grossing movie to that point, earning $237 million internationally. International success: 2001–2005. Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie's films to date had often not appealed to a wide audience, but """" (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular ""Tomb Raider"" videogame, Jolie was required to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the title role of Lara Croft. She was generally praised for her physical performance, but the movie generated mostly negative reviews. ""Slant"" commented, ""Angelina Jolie was born to play Lara Croft but Simon West makes her journey into a game of Frogger."" The movie was an international success nonetheless, earning $275 million worldwide, and launched her global reputation as a female action star. Jolie then starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in ""Original Sin"" (2001), a thriller based on the novel ""Waltz into Darkness"" by Cornell Woolrich. The film was a major critical failure, with ""The New York Times"" noting, ""The story plunges more precipitously than Ms. Jolie's neckline."" In 2002, she starred in ""Life or Something Like It"" as an ambitious television reporter who is told that she will die in a week. The film was poorly received by critics, though Jolie's performance received positive reviews. CNN's Paul Clinton wrote, ""Jolie is excellent in her role. Despite some of the ludicrous plot points in the middle of the film, this Academy Award-winning actress is exceedingly believable in her journey towards self-discovery and the true meaning of fulfilling life."" Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in """" (2003), which established her among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses. The sequel was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156 million at the international box office. She appeared in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the film. She next starred in ""Beyond Borders"" (2003), as a socialite who joins aid workers in Africa and Asia. The film reflected Jolie's real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, but it was critically and financially unsuccessful. The ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote, ""Jolie, as she did in her Oscar-winning role in ""Girl, Interrupted"", can bring electricity and believability to roles that have a reality she can understand. She can also, witness the ""Lara Croft"" films, do acknowledged cartoons. But the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her."" In 2004, Jolie starred alongside Ethan Hawke in the thriller ""Taking Lives"". She portrayed an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The movie received mixed reviews and ""The Hollywood Reporter"" concluded, ""Angelina Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour."" She also provided the voice of the angelfish Lola in the DreamWorks animated movie ""Shark Tale"" (2004), and had a brief appearance in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (2004), a science fiction adventure film shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen. That same year, Jolie played Olympias in ""Alexander"", about the life of Alexander the Great. The film failed domestically, which director Oliver Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, with revenue of $139 million outside the United States. 2005–2011. Jolie then starred opposite Brad Pitt in the 2005 action-comedy ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", which tells the story of a bored married couple, John and Jane Smith, who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads. The ""Star Tribune"" noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."" The movie earned $478 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest grossing film of 2005. Jolie next appeared in Robert De Niro's ""The Good Shepherd"" (2006), a film about the early history of the CIA, as seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson, an officer based on James Jesus Angleton and played by Matt Damon. Jolie played the supporting role of Margaret ""Clover"" Russell, Wilson's neglected wife. According to the ""Chicago Tribune"", ""Jolie ages convincingly throughout, and is blithely unconcerned with how her brittle character is coming off in terms of audience sympathy."" In 2007, Jolie made her directorial debut with the documentary ""A Place in Time"", which captures daily life in 27 locations around the world during a single week. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and was intended for distribution to high schools through the National Education Association. Jolie then starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama ""A Mighty Heart"" (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, ""The Wall Street Journal"" reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. ""The Hollywood Reporter"" described Jolie's performance as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent."" Jolie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. She also played Grendel's mother in the animated epic ""Beowulf"" (2007), which was created through the motion capture technique. Jolie co-starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the 2008 action movie ""Wanted"", an adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel of the same name. The film received predominately favorable reviews and proved an international success, earning $342 million worldwide. She also provided the voice of Master Tigress in the DreamWorks animated movie ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008). With revenue of $632 million internationally, it became the third-highest grossing film of 2008. That same year, Jolie took on the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama ""Changeling"". Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film stars Jolie as Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles—only to realize the boy is an impostor. The ""Chicago Tribune"" noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes [...] when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril."" Jolie received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a BAFTA Award. Jolie next starred in the 2010 thriller ""Salt"", her first film in two years. She starred alongside Liev Schreiber as CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character, Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role to director Phillip Noyce. The film was an international success with revenues of $294 million. It received mixed to positive reviews, with Jolie's performance earning praise; ""Empire"" remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business."" She also starred opposite Johnny Depp in ""The Tourist"" (2010), which received mostly negative critical reviews. Peter Travers wrote, ""Depp and Jolie hit career lows, producing the chemistry of high-fashion zombies."" Roger Ebert defended Jolie, stating she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality."" The ""Daily Mail"" reviewed the film as ""a glossy, sophisticated, gloriously improbable romp — escapist fun"". Despite the criticisms, after a domestic box office gross of over $67 million, the film went on to gross a respectable $278 million worldwide. Jolie received a controversial Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony. She won the 2011 Teen Choice Awards for movie actress in an action film. Jolie next reprised her voice role as Master Tigress in the animated DreamWorks sequel ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" (2011). It became the fourth-highest grossing film of 2011, and her highest-grossing film to date, earning $666 million at the international box office. 2011–present. In 2011, Jolie made her directorial feature debut with ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"", a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner of war, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She wrote the script after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, with the aim of rekindling attention for the survivors of a war that took place in recent history. To ensure a sense of authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia, most of whom lived through the war—including stars Goran Kosti? and Zana Marjanovi?—and incorporated their experiences into her script. The resulting film, which she also co-produced, was released in U.S. theaters entirely in the Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian language. ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" received mixed reviews from citics. Kenneth Turan of The ""Los Angeles Times"" criticized its ""contrived plot points,"" but ultimately acknowledged that, as a first-time director, ""Jolie accomplishes much in such a difficult area as the Bosnian war."" Writing for ""The New York Times"", Manohla Dargis likewise criticized Jolie's script, noting the story's ""somewhat awkward instructional, at times almost proselytizing aspect,"" but opined that, for the most part, the film ""moves briskly and easily holds your attention."" The film won the Stanley Kramer Award from the Producers Guild of America, which honors films that highlight provocative social issues, and received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It aroused both praise and criticism in the Balkans; the response from Bosniak war-victims advocacy organizations was ""overwhelmingly positive,"" while a Serb war prisoners group decried the film for its alleged anti-Serb bias. Sarajevo's regional government named Jolie an honorary citizen of the capital for raising awareness of the war. After a four-year absence from the screen, Jolie will star in the upcoming ""Maleficent"" (2014). She plays the titular role of Maleficent, the main antagonist from Disney's 1959 animated feature ""Sleeping Beauty"". The film will show the original story from Maleficent's perspective, revealing the character's background. She is also set to direct a film about World War II hero Lou Zamperini, a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Joel and Ethan Coen will rewrite the script, based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography """". Humanitarian work. UNHCR ambassadorship. Jolie first personally encountered the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming """" (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world. Upon her return home, she contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed. In the following months, she returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal, the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual. She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits. Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001. Over the next decade, she went on field missions around the world and met with refugees and internally displaced persons in more than 30 countries. In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon."" To that end, her 2001-02 field visits were chronicled in her book ""Notes from My Travels"", which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her film ""Beyond Borders"". She aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from, and she became noted for going ""where real bullets fly,"" traveling to such war zones as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict, the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War, where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces, and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit. On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she represents UNHCR and Guterres at the diplomatic level to facilitate lasting solutions for people displaced by major crises. In the months following the promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees, and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria. Millennium Village and other projects. In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province of Battambang, adjacent to a national park infiltrated with poachers who threatened the dwindling populations of Asian black bears, Asian elephants, and Indochinese tigers. She purchased the surrounding 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project. In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005. In 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Project (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals. She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, ""The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa"", which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in Western Kenya. By 2007, some 6000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters. In addition to the facilities at MJP, Jolie has built at least ten other schools in Cambodia, and funds the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a care facility for children affected by HIV, in the capital Phnom Penh. In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her daughter, she funds the Zahara Children's Center, which treats children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee. She has also built schools elsewhere in the world, including a school and a boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya, a school for girls in Tangi, Afghanistan, and another girls-only school in the Afghan capital Kabul. These facilities and other projects are funded through the Jolie–Pitt Foundation, which Jolie and her partner Brad Pitt established in September 2006. Political and legal involvement. Jolie became more involved in promoting humanitarian causes on a political level from 2003 onwards. She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital, where she had met with senators and representatives of Congress at least 20 times by 2006. She has been involved in child and women protection efforts, pushing for legislation to aid child refugees and other vulnerable children in both developing nations and the U.S., and fronting an international campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones. She explained in 2006, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball."" Since its founding at the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Jolie has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which funds education programs for children affected by disaster. In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups. The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank. Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations in June 2007. Jolie also co-chairs Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), which provides free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S. She founded KIND in October 2008, in a collaboration with the Microsoft Corporation and 25 leading U.S. law firms. She had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded a similar initiative, the then-newly launched National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children. In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship, whose member attorneys—the first of whom was appointed in January 2011—assist and support government officials and other organizations in their efforts to secure the legal protection of Haiti's most vulnerable children. In May 2012, Jolie joined UK Foreign Secretary William Hague in a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones, the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. To highlight the problem, Jolie and Hague subsequently travelled to eastern DR Congo, where rape has been frequently used as a weapon of war by rebel groups and soldiers. In 2013, she spoke at a G8 foreign ministers meeting, where ministers pledged $36 million in funding to go toward developing international standards for the investigation and prosecution of war rape, and before the UN security council—the UN's most powerful body—which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date. Recognition. Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program, and in 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association. She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in 2005, and she received the Freedom Award by the International Rescue Committee in 2007. In 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. She is set to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Board of Governors, in November 2013. Personal life. Relationships. Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way."" She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16. During filming of ""Hackers"" (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens. They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after on March 28, 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood. Jolie and Miller separated in September 1997 and divorced on February 3, 1999. They remained on good terms, and Jolie later explained, ""It comes down to timing. I think he's the greatest husband a girl could ask for. I'll always love him, we were simply too young."" Jolie had a brief relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of ""Foxfire"" (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her."" Shimizu claimed in 2005 that her relationship with Jolie had lasted many years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people. In 2003, asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!"" After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They met on the set of ""Pushing Tin"" (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern. As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a son from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. Asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet."" In early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She and Pitt were alleged to have started an affair during filming of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (2005). She denied this on several occasions, but later admitted that they ""fell in love"" on the set. She explained in 2005, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."" Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when Jolie confirmed to ""People"" that she was pregnant with Pitt's child. Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012, after seven years together. The couple—dubbed ""Brangelina"" by the entertainment media—are the subject of worldwide media coverage. Children. On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child, seven-month-old Maddox Chivan, from an orphanage in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001, in a local village. Jolie applied for adoption after she had visited Cambodia twice, while filming """" (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission. The adoption process was halted in December 2001 when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking. Once the adoption was finalized, she took custody of Maddox in Namibia, where she was filming ""Beyond Borders"" (2003). Although Jolie and her then-husband Billy Bob Thornton announced the adoption together, she in fact adopted Maddox as a single parent. Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005. Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa. At the time of the adoption, Zahara was wrongly believed to be an AIDS orphan and it was unknown whether she herself had contracted HIV, but she later tested negative. Shortly after they returned to the United States, Zahara was hospitalized for dehydration and malnutrition. In November 2007, media outlets reported that Zahara's biological mother wanted her daughter back, but she denied these reports, saying she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie. Jolie was accompanied by her partner Brad Pitt when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara. She later indicated that she and Pitt had made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia together. In December 2005, Pitt's publicist announced that Pitt was seeking to adopt Maddox and Zahara. To reflect this, Jolie filed a request to legally change her children's surnames from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006. The adoptions were finalized soon after. In an attempt to avoid the media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt went to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child. On May 27, 2006, Jolie gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would have a Namibian passport. The couple decided to sell the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images themselves, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs. ""People"" paid a reported $4.1 million for the North American rights, while ""Hello!"" obtained the British rights for a reported $3.5 million. All profits were donated to charities serving African children. On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned soon after birth. Jolie adopted Pax as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt. The rights for the first post-adoption images of Pax were sold to ""People"" for a reported $2 million, as well as to ""Hello!"" for an undisclosed amount. In April, Jolie filed a request to legally change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31, 2007. Pitt's adoption of Pax was finalized in the United States on February 21, 2008. At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade. She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to ""People"" and ""Hello!"" for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken. The proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation. Cancer prevention treatment. On February 16, 2013, at the age of 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer at the age of 56, while her maternal grandmother had ovarian cancer and died aged 45. Her maternal aunt Debbie Martin, who had the same defective BRCA1 gene as Jolie, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and died at age 61 on May 26, 2013. Jolie's mastectomy lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, and testing of the removed breast tissue showed no signs of cancerous cells. On April 27, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. She reportedly intends to undergo a preventive oophorectomy, as she still has a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Jolie kept news of her mastectomy private until she had completed the three-month process. On May 14, ""The New York Times"" published an op-ed titled ""My Medical Choice"" in which Jolie wrote about her decision and procedures, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. To that end, her treatment regimen was posted on the website of the Pink Lotus Breast Center, where she was treated. In her piece—published concurrently with U.S. Supreme Court deliberations on BRCA gene patent rights held by Myriad Genetics—Jolie acknowledged the largely prohibitive cost of BRCA gene testing and advocated wider accessibility. On June 13, 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that isolated genes are not patentable, invalidating the BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics. Jolie's announcement drew extensive public attention; a ""Time"" cover story titled ""The Angelina Effect"" observed that Jolie brought ""genetic testing in the spotlight,"" and noted her ability to influence people on a large scale. Various public figures applauded Jolie for her decision; UK foreign secretary William Hague, who visited refugee camps in Congo-Kinshasa with Jolie in March, called her ""an inspiration to many."" Most medical experts who weighed in publicly agreed that Jolie made the right choice for herself, but differed in their response to its expected influence on the public. Her decision was met with praise from health campaigners, who welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to those at risk, while other experts feared a widespread overestimation of BRCA mutation occurrence, as less than 1% of all women carry this genetic condition, and a misunderstanding of the risks involved for those who do test positive. Eric Topol, a geneticist and director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in California, told attendees at a genetics symposium ""This is the moment that will propel genomic medicine forward"", saying that Jolie's announcement was ""incredibly important symbolically"". In the media. During the first decade of her career, Jolie—who does not employ a publicist or an agent—maintained a ""wild child"" persona in her communication with the media. She openly discussed her love life, including her bisexuality and her interest in BDSM. After she kissed her brother during the Academy Awards in 2000, their close relationship became the subject of tabloid media speculation, which she dismissed. She spoke about her experiences with drugs and depression, and recalled the time, in 1997, when she almost hired a hitman to kill her, as well as the three days, just before her marriage to Billy Bob Thornton, that she was sectioned at UCLA's psychiatric ward. By the mid-2000s, Jolie's involvement with the UNHCR and the adoption of her son Maddox had transformed her public image from Hollywood eccentric into humanitarian and devoted mother. Jolie has attracted notable media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her full lips and her many tattoos, being her most distinctive features. She has been named the world's ""most beautiful"" or ""sexiest"" woman by various media outlets, including ""Vogue"" in 2002, ""Esquire"" in 2004, American ""FHM"" and British ""Harper's Bazaar"" in 2005, ""People"" and ""Hello!"" in 2006, ""Empire"" in 2007, and ""Vanity Fair"" in 2009. ""People"" named her one of 2012's Most Beautiful at Every Age. Jolie's extensive collection of tattoos has often been addressed by interviewers. She has fourteen known tattoos, among which the Latin proverb ""quod me nutrit me destruit"" (what nourishes me destroys me), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages,"" two sak yant designs featuring a prayer of protection and a twelve-inch-by-eight-inch tiger, and seven sets of geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her children and her partner Brad Pitt. Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including the name of her second husband, ""Billy Bob"", and the Chinese characters ""?"" (death) and ""?"" (courage). Jolie holds a private pilot license and owns a single-engine Cirrus SR22 aircraft. Today, Jolie is one of the best-known celebrities around the world. According to the Q Score, in 2000, subsequent to her Oscar win, 31% of respondents in the United States said Jolie was familiar to them; by 2006 she was familiar to 81% of Americans. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with partner Brad Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide. She was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and in 2011 had an endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton reportedly worth $10 million—a record for a single advertising campaign. She was among the ""Time"" 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as assembled by ""Time"", in 2006 and 2008. ""Forbes"" named her Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively, and she topped the magazine's Celebrity 100, a ranking of the world's most powerful celebrities, in 2009. On July 23, 2009, serving as a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie made a third trip to the Iraq War, visiting the U.S. troops stationed in 'Camp Liberty' in Baghdad's International Zone. During an interview there, she mentioned having also visited Washington, D.C.'s Walter Reed Army Medical Center: ""...I was INSPIRED and reminded of all the bravery of... of all you young and, men and WOMEN...I'm always just HONOURED to spend time with, with everybody who spends time in the military...I was allowed to come and I'm privileged to be here."" An unauthorized biography on Jolie by Andrew Morton was published in 2010. Janet Maslin highlights the lack of sources noted in the book in a review in ""The New York Times"", saying ""the people most eager to tell him about Ms. Jolie are people who don’t know her, so that the book is shrink-wrapped in glib insights from dubious psychiatric talents"". Allen Barra describes it as ""the worst book in the 21st century so far"" in a ""Salon"" review which summarizes the book as ""ill-informed, moralistic and just plain mean"". "

Crowe returned to Australia at age 21, intending to apply to the National Institute of Dramatic Art. ""I was working in a theatre show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA"", Crowe has recalled. ""I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things you go there to learn and you've been doing it for most of your life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'"" From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a production of ""The Rocky Horror Show"". He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott. He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show. In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work.

However, he failed to win the Oscar that year, losing to Denzel Washington. It has been suggested by the ""Guardian"" and ""Entertainment Weekly"" that his attack on television producer Malcolm Gerrie for cutting short his acceptance speech may have turned voters against him. All three films were also nominated for best picture, and both ""Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" won the award.

Crowe performed lead vocals and guitar for the band, which formed in 1992. The band released ""The Photograph Kills EP"" in 1995 as well as three full length records, ""Gaslight"" (1998), ""Bastard Life or Clarity"" (2001) and ""Other Ways of Speaking"" (2003). In 2000 TOFOG performed shows in London, Los Angeles and the now famous run of shows at Stubbs in Austin, Texas which became a live DVD that was released in 2001 called ""Texas"". In 2001 the band came to the US for major press, radio and TV appearances for the ""Bastard Life or Clarity"" release and returned Stubbs in Austin, Texas to kick off a sold out US tour with dates in Austin, Boulder, Chicago, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York City and the last show at the famous Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey. In early 2005, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts as a group has ""dissolved/evolved"" with Crowe feeling his future music would take a new direction and he began a collaboration with Alan Doyle of the Canadian band Great Big Sea, and with it a new band: The Ordinary Fear of God which also involved some members of the previous TOFOG line-up. A new single, ""Raewyn"", was released in April 2005 and an album entitled ""My Hand, My Heart"" which was released and is available for download on iTunes. The album includes a tribute song to actor Richard Harris, who became Crowe's friend during the making of ""Gladiator"".

During location filming of ""Cinderella Man"", Crowe made a donation to a Jewish elementary school whose library had been damaged as a result of arson. A note with an anti-Semitic message had been left at the scene. Crowe called school officials to express his concern and wanted his message relayed to the students. The school's building fund received donations from throughout Canada and the amount of Crowe's donation was not disclosed. On another occasion, Crowe donated a large sum of money ($200,000) to a struggling primary school near his home in rural Australia. Crowe's sympathies were sparked when a pupil drowned at the nearby Coffs Harbour beach in 2001, and he believes the pool will help students become better swimmers and improve their knowledge of water safety. At the opening ceremony he dived into the pool fully clothed as soon as the venue was declared open. Nana Glen principal Laurie Renshall says, ""The many things he does up here, people just don't know about. We've been trying to get a pool for 10 years."" Personal life. Relationships and family. Crowe began an on-again, off-again relationship with Australian singer Danielle Spencer in 1989, when they co-starred in the 1990 film ""The Crossing"". Crowe and Spencer reconciled in 2001 and married on 7 April 2003 (Crowe's 39th birthday) at Crowe's cattle property in Nana Glen, New South Wales.

This Nana Glen property, a cattle farm (700 Black Angus), includes a chapel that Crowe built for his wedding to Danielle Spencer. In 2011, Crowe and his family moved to a house with a garden in Sydney´s Rose Bay.

On 9 March 2005, Crowe revealed to ""GQ"" magazine that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents had approached him prior to the 73rd Academy Awards on 25 March 2001 and told him that the terrorist group al-Qaeda wanted to kidnap him. Crowe told the magazine that it was the first time he had ever heard of al-Qaeda and was quoted as saying: Crowe recalled that: Crowe was guarded by United States Secret Service agents for the next few months, both while shooting films and at award ceremonies. Scotland Yard also guarded Crowe while he was promoting ""Proof of Life"" in London in February 2001. Stamps series Australian Legends of the Screen.

He, Geoffrey Rush, Cate Blanchett, and Nicole Kidman each appear twice in the series: once as themselves and once as their Academy Award-winning character. Interests and other information. From his youth to the present, Crowe has had a special love of horses. ""They're just like people,"" he told CraveOnline, ""there are some horses that you have a deeper connection with immediately, and you can work on that over time."" He has also noted that he sometimes finds it difficult to part with his equine co-stars when a film involving horses wraps. Crowe stated in November 2007 that he would like to be baptised a Christian, and feels that he has put it off for too long. ""I do believe there are more important things than what is in the mind of a man,"" he says. ""There is something much bigger that drives us all. I'm willing to take that leap of faith."" In June 2010, Crowe, who had started smoking when he was only 10, announced he had quit for the sake of his two sons. On 10 November 2010, Crowe told David Letterman that he had been smoking more than 60 cigarettes a day for 36 years of his life, and that he had fallen off the wagon the previous night and smoked heavily. By April 2011, it was officially confirmed that Crowe's attempt to quit smoking was unsuccessful.

During this period he lost reducing his weight from to . Crowe publicly endorsed Barack Obama, whom he called ""the light and the future"", in the 2012 US presidential election, and urged Americans to vote for him. Crowe also publicly endorsed Julia Gillard, whom he called ""Leader through tough times"", in the 2013 Australian federal election, although he was unable to vote for her as he is not an Australian citizen. Sport. Rugby league. Crowe is a known sports fan and has been a supporter of the rugby league football team the South Sydney Rabbitohs since childhood. Since his rise to fame as an actor, he has continued appearing at home games, and supported the financially troubled club. Following the Super League war of the 1990s Crowe made an attempt to use his Hollywood connections to convince Ted Turner, rival of Super League's Rupert Murdoch, to save the Rabbitohs before they were forced from the National Rugby League competition for two years. In 1999 Crowe paid $42,000 at auction for the brass bell used to open the inaugural rugby league match in Australia in 1908 at a fund-raiser to assist Souths' legal battle for re-inclusion in the League. In 2005, he made the Rabbitohs the first club team in Australia to be sponsored by a film, when he negotiated a deal to advertise his film ""Cinderella Man"" on their jerseys. Crowe is friends with many current and former players of the club, and currently employs former South Sydney forward Mark Carroll as a bodyguard and personal trainer. He has encouraged other actors to support the club, such as Tom Cruise and Burt Reynolds. On 19 March 2006, the voting members of the South Sydney club voted (in a 75.8% majority) to allow Crowe and businessman Peter Holmes à Court to purchase 75% of the organisation, leaving 25% ownership with the members. It cost them A$3 million, and they received four of eight seats on the board of directors. A six part television miniseries entitled ""South Side Story"" depicting the takeover aired in Australia in 2007. On 5 November 2006, Crowe appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" to announce that Firepower International was sponsoring the South Sydney Rabbitohs for $3 million over three years. During a ""Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" appearance, watched by over 11 million viewers, Crowe showed viewers a Rabbitoh playing jersey with Firepower's name emblazoned on it. Crowe helped to organise a rugby league game that took place in Jacksonville, Florida between the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the English Super League champions Leeds Rhinos on 26 January 2008 (Australia Day). The game was played at the University of North Florida. Crowe told ITV Local Yorkshire the game was not a marketing exercise. Crowe wrote a letter of apology to a Sydney newspaper following the sacking of South Sydney's coach Jason Taylor and one of their players David Fa'alogo after a drunken altercation between the two at the end of the 2009 NRL season. Also in 2009 Crowe persuaded young England international forward Sam Burgess to sign with the Rabbitohs over other clubs that were competing for his signature, after inviting Burgess and his mother to the set of ""Robin Hood"", which he was filming in England at the time. In the 2010 post-season it was reported that Crowe's influence was critical in persuading Greg Inglis, one of the world's best players, to renege on his deal to join the Brisbane Broncos and sign for the Rabbitohs for 2011. On 5 December 2010 the ""Sunday Telegraph"" reported that the NRL was investigating the business relationships Russell Crowe has with a number of media and entertainment companies in relation to the South Sydney Rabbitohs' salary cap. Salary cap auditor Ian Schubert was reported to be delving into Crowe's recent dealings with Channel Nine, Channel Seven, ANZ Stadium and V8 Supercars. On 26 January 2011 the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" reported that the Rabbitohs were about to embark on a five-year multi-million dollar sponsorship deal with the giant Star City Casino. Souths also announced a corporate partnership with the bookmaking conglomerate Luxbet. Previously Crowe had been prominent in trying to prevent gambling being associated with the Rabbitohs. Reuters, on 3 January 2008, reported that Crowe was ""fighting a new gladiatorial combat to wean his countrymen off their addiction to gambling machines."" In May 2011 Crowe was credited for an arrangement with Fox to have the 2011 State of Origin series broadcast live for the first time in the United States, in addition to the NRL Grand Final. In November 2012 the South Sydney Rabbitohs confirmed that Russell Crowe was selling his 37.5% stake in the club. At the Rabbitohs Annual General Meeting on 3 March 2013, Chairman Nick Pappas claimed Crowe """"would not be selling his shareholding in the short-to-medium term and at this stage has no intention of selling at all"""". Other sporting interests. In football (soccer), Crowe said he followed Bristol City and Leeds United. Crowe watches and plays cricket. He played in school, and his cousins Martin Crowe and Jeff Crowe are former Black Caps Captains. Russell Crowe captained the 'Australian' Team containing Steve Waugh against an English side in the 'Hollywood Ashes' Cricket Match. On 17 July 2009 Crowe took to the commentary box for the British sports channel, Sky Sports, as the 'third man' during the second Test of the 2009 Ashes series, between England and Australia. Crowe supports the Leeds Rhinos in the Super League and the Richmond Tigers in the Australian Football League (AFL) Crowe supports the University of Michigan Wolverines American football team, an interest that stems from his friendship with former Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr. Carr used Crowe's movie ""Cinderella Man"" to motivate his team in 2006 following a disappointing 7–5 season the previous year. Upon hearing of this, Crowe called Carr and invited him to Australia to address his Rugby league team the South Sydney Rabbitohs, an offer Carr took Crowe up on the following summer. In September 2007, after Carr came under fire following the Wolverines' 0–2 start, Crowe travelled to Ann Arbor, Michigan for the Wolverines' 15 September game against Notre Dame to show his support for Carr. He addressed the team before the game and watched from the sidelines as the Wolverines defeated the Irish 38–0.  Crowe is also a fan of the National Football League, and on 22 October 2007 appeared in the booth of a Monday Night game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars. He is also a devout fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs which stems from his shooting of ""Cinderella Man"" at Maple Leaf Gardens. Altercations and controversies. Between 1999 and 2005 Crowe was involved in four altercations which gave him a reputation for having a bad temper. In 1999, Crowe was involved in a scuffle at the Plantation Hotel in Coffs Harbour, Australia, which was caught on security video. Two men were acquitted of using the video in an attempt to blackmail Crowe. Four years later, when part of Crowe's appearance at the 2002 BAFTA awards was cut out to fit into the BBC's tape-delayed broadcast, Crowe used strong language during an argument with producer Malcolm Gerrie. The part cut was a poem in tribute to actor Richard Harris who was then terminally ill, and was cut for copyright reasons. Crowe later apologised, saying ""What I said to him may have been a little bit more passionate than now, in the cold light of day, I would have liked it to have been."" Later that year, Crowe was alleged to have been involved in a ""brawl"" with businessman and fellow New Zealander Eric Watson inside a fashionable Japanese restaurant in London. The fight was broken up by British actor Ross Kemp. In June 2005, Crowe was arrested and charged with second-degree assault by New York City police, after he threw a telephone at an employee of the Mercer Hotel who refused to help him place a call when the system did not work from his room, and was charged with fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon (the telephone). The employee, a concierge, was treated for a facial laceration. After his arrest Crowe underwent a perp walk, a procedure customary especially in New York exposing the enchained suspect to the news media to take pictures. This procedure was under discussion as potentially violating Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Crowe later described the incident as ""possibly the most shameful situation that I've ever gotten myself in... and I've done some pretty dumb things in my life"". Crowe pleaded guilty and was conditionally discharged. Before the trial he settled a lawsuit filed by the concierge, Nestor Estrada. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed but amounts in the six-figure range have been suggested. Crowe's altercations were lampooned in the ""South Park"" episode, ""The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer"". The telephone incident had a generally negative impact on Crowe's public image, an example of negative public relations in the mass media. A professional public image as ""The Gladiator"" had to compete alongside one as ""the telephone throwing actor"". Crowe commented the ongoing media perpetuation in November 2010, five years into the process, during an interview with American television talk show host and journalist Charlie Rose: ""it affected me psychologically"" (...) ""it indelibly changed me"". A new drive to the topic brought the actor's participation in the microblogging service Twitter from April 2010. In June 2011, Crowe expressed in the course of a friendly Twitter conversation with his colleague, Jewish screenwriter Eli Roth, his views against infant circumcision, calling the practice ""barbaric"" and asking, ""Who are you to correct nature? Is it real that requires a donation of foreskin? Babies are [born perfect."" The comments coincided with a debate to ban the procedure on infants in California, USA. Crowe, living in New South Wales, Australia, and not being a member of any church, removed the comments the following day and tweeted an apology: ""My personal beliefs aside I realise that some will interpret this debate as me mocking the rituals and traditions of others. I am very sorry."" Since 15 November 2011 Crowe has supported the Occupy Wall Street movement via Twitter, asking his 310,000 followers to listen to Keith Olbermann reading the Occupy Wall Street Declaration and stating on 15 November 2011 via his Twitter account Close encounters. On 5 March 2013, Crowe posted a video on YouTube purporting to show a UFO flying over Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens, recorded four years earlier. Crowe and his friend, cinematographer Duane Manwiller, had set up cameras to film fruit bats, but captured footage of the unexplained phenomenon instead. Crowe has been accused of perpetrating a publicity stunt, which his publicist denies. "

She appeared in several television series and commercials, before acquiring her first significant role prior to her 15th birthday, playing Jackie Burkhart on the television series ""That '70s Show"". A year later, she was cast as the voice of Meg Griffin on the animated series ""Family Guy"". Her breakout film role came in 2008, playing Rachel Jansen in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". Subsequent film roles included Mona Sax in ""Max Payne"", Solara in ""The Book of Eli"", Jamie in ""Friends with Benefits"", Lori in the comedy ""Ted"", and Theodora in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"". Her performance as Lily in ""Black Swan"" gained her worldwide accolades, including receiving the Premio Marcello Mastroianni for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role. Early life. Kunis was born in Chernivtsi, in the Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine). Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a mechanical engineer who works as a cab driver. Kunis has a brother, Michael, who is six years older. She stated in 2011 that her parents had ""amazing jobs"", and that the family was ""very lucky"" and ""not poor""; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw ""no future"" there for Kunis and her brother. In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California with $250. “That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA.” Kunis is Jewish and has cited antisemitism in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States. She has stated that her parents ""raised Jewish as much as they could,"" although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union. On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: ""I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States."" Education. In Los Angeles, she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School. She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming ""That '70s Show"". When not on the set, she attended Fairfax High School, from which she graduated in 2001. She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Career. 1994–2000: Career beginnings and television work. At age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager. On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial. Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line. Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on ""Days of Our Lives"", and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on ""Baywatch"". She had a minor role on ""7th Heaven"" and supporting roles in ""Santa with Muscles"", ""Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves"", and the Angelina Jolie film ""Gia"", as the young Gia Carangi. At the age of 10, Kunis auditioned for but failed to get the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film ""Make a Wish, Molly"". Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom ""That '70s Show"". All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. ""That '70s Show"" ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive ""Young Star Awards"" as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances. In 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom ""Family Guy"", created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on ""That '70s Show"". MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Upon claiming that she had mastered these speech particulars, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: ""What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila – something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Often times with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound often times very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work."" Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the ""Family Guy Video Game!"". Kunis described her character as ""the scapegoat."" 2001–2008: Transition to film. In 2001, she appeared in ""Get Over It"" opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film ""American Psycho 2"" alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film ""American Psycho"". ""American Psycho 2"" was panned by critics, and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film. In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation ""Tony n' Tina's Wedding"". Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007. Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes. ""DVD talk"" concluded that ""fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place"". In 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in ""Moving McAllister"", which was not released theatrically until 2007. The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters. She followed up with ""After Sex"" starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in ""Get Over It"". In October 2006, she began filming ""Boot Camp"" (originally titled ""Straight Edge""). The film was not released in theatres in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009. Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", co-produced by Judd Apatow.

The film garnered positive reviews, and was a commercial success, grossing $105 million worldwide. Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of ""The Wall Street Journal"" praised her ""fresh beauty and focused energy"", while James Berardinelli wrote that she is ""adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing"". She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award. In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from ""That '70s Show"". Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film ""Max Payne"", based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role. ""Max Payne"" was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide but was panned by critics, with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast. Travis Estvold of ""Boise Weekly"" wrote that she's ""horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss"". Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, ""Mila just bowled us over...She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park."" She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film. 2009–2012: Film breakthrough and acclaim. In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film ""Extract"" with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis ""brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility."" Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film ""Rejected"". Judge said: ""As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world."" After seeing Kunis perform in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in ""Extract"": ""I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic."" Said Kunis, ""I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from ""Office Space"", so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting."" In 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film ""The Book of Eli"". Although the film received mixed reviews, it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157 million worldwide. Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a ""particularly strong piece of work"". Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of ""Boxoffice"" magazine, who wrote that she's ""ideally cast in the key female role"" Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that ""the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts"", and Colin Covert of the ""Star Tribune"", who wrote that she ""generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing."" Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of ""USA Today"" felt she was miscast, noting that ""she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial"". Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance. Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film ""Date Night"", starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell. She garnered several positive reviews for her performance. Michael Phillips of the ""Chicago Tribune"" concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it ""a shot in the arm."" Kunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film ""Black Swan"". She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman. She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20 pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week. During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder. ""Black Swan"" has received widespread acclaim from critics and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film grossed over $106.9 million in the United States and Canada while grossing over $329 million worldwide. Reviews of Kunis's performance have been positive, with Kirk Honeycutt of ""The Hollywood Reporter"" stating, ""Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness."" Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, ""it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness."" Kunis' performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and earned her Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.

Manohla Dargis of ""The New York Times"" wrote that ""Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she's a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy"" and ""her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen"". In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in ""Ted"", her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her.

She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film. The film, and Kunis' performance, received mixed reviews from critics. Kim Newman of ""Empire Magazine"" wrote that Kunis ""walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle"".

Anne Hathaway was born November 12, 1982 in Brooklyn, New York. Her father, Gerald Thomas Hathaway, is a lawyer, and her mother, Kathleen Ann ""Kate"" (née McCauley), is an actress who inspired Hathaway to follow in her footsteps. Hathaway's mother played Fantine in the first U.S. tour of ""Les Misérables"". When she was six years old, the family moved to Millburn, New Jersey, which is where she grew up. Hathaway has an older brother, Michael, and a younger brother, Thomas. She is of mostly Irish and French ancestry, with distant Native American and German roots. Hathaway was raised Roman Catholic with what she considered ""really strong values"", and has stated she wanted to be a nun during her childhood. However, she decided against it at the age of 15, after learning her brother Michael was gay. She has stated: ""I realised my older brother was gay, and I couldn't support a religion that didn't support my brother. Now I call myself a nondenominational Christian, because I haven't found the religion for me."" In 2009, Hathaway stated that her religious beliefs are ""a work in progress"". Hathaway attended Brooklyn Heights Montessori School and Wyoming Elementary School in Millburn. Hathaway graduated from Millburn High School, where she participated in many school plays; her high school performance as Winnifred in ""Once Upon a Mattress"" gained her a Paper Mill Playhouse Rising Star Award nomination for Best Performance by a High School Actress. During this time, Hathaway was in plays including ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Gigi"" at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse. She spent several semesters studying as an English major and Women's Studies minor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York before transferring to New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study, referring to her college enrollment as one of her best decisions, because she enjoyed being with others who were trying to ""grow up"". She also studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Hathaway was the first teenager admitted into The Barrow Group Theater Company's acting program. A soprano, Hathaway performed in 1998 and 1999 with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus at Carnegie Hall and has performed in plays at Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey.

Hathaway is a trained stage actress and has stated that she prefers performing on stage to film roles. Her acting style has been compared to those of Judy Garland and Audrey Hepburn. She cites Garland as one of her favorite actresses and Meryl Streep as her idol. Career. 2001–04: Career development. Hathaway's first role in a motion picture was opposite Christopher Gorham in Walt Disney's drama film ""The Other Side of Heaven"" (2001), inspired by John H. Groberg's memoir ""In the Eye of the Storm"". Before production of the film, she was cast alongside Julie Andrews in the lead role of Mia Thermopolis in another Disney production, the comedy film ""The Princess Diaries"", based on Meg Cabot's 2000 novel of the same name and directed by Garry Marshall. Hathaway auditioned for the role of a princess-to-be during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand and was cast on the strength of this one audition. She won the role over 500 other girls. Released prior to ""The Other Side of Heaven"" in hopes that its success would increase interest in ""Heaven"", ""The Princess Diaries"" became a major commercial success, grossing US$165 million worldwide. Many critics praised Hathaway's performance, with a BBC critic noting that ""Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry."" Also released in 2001, ""The Other Side of Heaven"", directed by Mitch Davis, met with mostly negative reviews, but it performed well for a religion-themed film. In February 2002, Hathaway starred in the City Center Encores! concert production of ""Carnival!"" in her New York City stage debut, receiving positive reviews for her portrayal of Lili. Also in 2002, Hathaway began voicing the audio book releases of ""The Princess Diaries"" and has since voiced the first three books of the series. She also provided the voice of the character Haru in the English version of Hiroyuki Morita's ""The Cat Returns."" Hathaway continued to appear in family-oriented films over the next three years, subsequently becoming known in mainstream media as a children's role model. In 2002, she appeared in Douglas McGrath's comedy-drama ""Nicholas Nickleby"", opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, which opened to positive reviews. The ""Deseret News"" said that the cast was ""Oscar-worthy"". Despite critical acclaim, the film never entered wide release and failed at the North American box office, totaling less than $4 million in ticket sales. Hathaway's next film role was as the titular character in the rom-com fantasy film ""Ella Enchanted"" (2004), a loose adaption of Gail Carson Levine's 1997 novel of the same name, which opened to mostly indifferent reviews. Hathaway sang two songs in the film as well as three on the soundtrack, including a duet with singer Jesse McCartney. In 2003, Hathaway dropped out of her role in Joel Schumacher's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (2004), because the production schedule of the film overlapped with """", which she was contractually obligated to make. Disney began production on ""The Princess Diaries 2"" in early 2004, and it was released in August of that year. The film opened to negative reviews, but made $95.1 million against a $40 million budget. 2005–07: Career transition. Hathaway began appearing in dramatic roles after ""The Princess Diaries 2"". She said that ""anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve"", although she noted that ""it's lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me"". She voiced Red Puckett in the animated comedy ""Hoodwinked!"" (2005), based on the ""Little Red Riding Hood"" folktale, which received mixed reviews by critics. Hathaway replaced Red's original voice artist Tara Strong and sang the song ""Great Big World"". That same year, Hathaway starred in Barbara Kopple's drama film ""Havoc"", in which she played a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. Although the content of the film was different from her previous films, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that doing nudity in certain movies is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; and because of that belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable. After ""Havoc,"" Hathaway was cast alongside Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ang Lee's drama ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005). While ""Havoc"" was not released in theaters in the United States because of its weak critical reception, ""Brokeback Mountain"" won rave reviews and received several Academy Award nominations. Hathaway would later assert that the content of ""Brokeback Mountain"" was more important than its award count and that making the film made her more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actress. In 2006, Hathaway appeared in David Frankel's comedy ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" in which she starred as an assistant to a powerful fashion magazine editor portrayed by Meryl Streep, whom Hathaway described as being ""just divine"". Hathaway said that working on the film made her respect the fashion industry a great deal more than she had previously, though she claimed that her personal style is something she ""still can't get right"". In an interview with ""Us Weekly"", Hathaway discussed the weight loss regimen she and co-star Emily Blunt followed for the film, she stated, ""I basically stuck with fruit, vegetables and fish slim down. I wouldn't recommend that. Emily Blunt and I would clutch at each other and cry because we were so hungry."" Hathaway was cast in the 2007 comedy ""Knocked Up"", but dropped out before filming began and was replaced by Katherine Heigl. Writer/director Judd Apatow stated in a May 2007 issue of ""The New York Times Magazine"" that this happened because ""she didn't want to allow us to use real footage of a woman giving birth to create the illusion that she is giving birth"". In an August 2008 interview with ""Marie Claire"", Hathaway commented that she ""didn't believe that it was necessary to the story"". Hathaway was in the 2007 drama ""Becoming Jane,"" in which she portrayed English writer Jane Austen. Tim Burton considered Hathaway for the part of Johanna Barker in his 2007 film "","" but the role went to Jayne Wisener, a then-unknown actress, reportedly because Burton decided he wanted an unknown, younger actress for the part. 2008–10: Continued success. In January 2008, Hathaway joined beauty giant Lancôme as the face of their fragrance Magnifique, and in October of that year, Hathaway hosted the NBC late-night sketch comedy ""Saturday Night Live"".

Also in 2008, she premiered the drama ""Passengers,"" alongside Patrick Wilson, as well as the drama ""Rachel Getting Married,"" opposite Debra Winger. ""Rachel Getting Married"" premiered at the 2008 Venice and Toronto Film Festivals and garnered her widespread critical acclaim for her performance as Kym, including nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Hathaway said that the film appealed to her because of its real depiction of relationships and because of the strong emotional connection she felt with her character. Hathaway appeared in the comedy ""Bride Wars"", released in 2009, which she described as being ""hideously commercial – gloriously so"". In addition to providing her voice for episodes of ""The Simpsons"", which garnered her an Emmy Award in 2010 for outstanding voice-over performance, and ""Family Guy"" in 2010, Hathaway also appeared as Viola in the New York Shakespeare Festival's summer 2009 production of ""Twelfth Night"" at the Delacorte Theater in New York City's Central Park, opposite Audra McDonald as Olivia, Raul Esparza as Duke Orsino, and Julie White as Maria. In the same year, Hathaway was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2010, Hathaway played the White Queen in Tim Burton's adaptation of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass"" alongside Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. She summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; ""Cute but psycho. Things even out."" Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as ""a punk-rock vegan pacifist"", with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry, Greta Garbo, and the artwork of Dan Flavin. Other projects included the romantic comedy ""The Fiancé"", an adaptation of the Julie Buxbaum novel ""The Opposite of Love"", the Garry Marshall-directed ensemble comedy ""Valentine's Day"", and an adaptation of Gerald Clarke's biography ""Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland,"" in which she will play the title role on the stage and screen.

Hardy would not have transformed into the Black Cat, as in the comics; instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a brand-new superpowered figure called the Vulturess. On January 5, 2010, it was reported that ""Spider-Man 4"" would be rewritten and Hathaway would not appear in the film, as she was ""too expensive"". On November 29, 2010, it was announced that Hathaway and James Franco would host the 83rd Academy Awards.

A commercial success, it went on to gross over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. Also in 2011, Hathaway starred alongside Jim Sturgess in the romance ""One Day"". Adapted by David Nicholls from his 2009 novel of the same name and directed by Lone Scherfig, the film tells the story of two young people who meet on the same day, July 15, for the twenty years after they share a one-night stand together at university. Hathaway was clandestinely given the script as ""One Day"" was set in the United Kingdom and Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. After a nonproductive meeting with Scherfig, Hathaway left a list of songs for Scherfig to listen to, which eventually led to Hathaway getting the part. However, Hathaway's Yorkshire accent in the role of Emma was later widely regarded as subpar. Columnist Suzanne Moore, reviewing the film on BBC Radio 4's ""Front Row"", said the accents were ""all over the shop"". Moore went on to say, ""Sometimes she's from Scotland, sometimes she's from New York, you just can't tell"". The film itself received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but became a moderate box office success, grossing a total of $56.7 million with a budget of $15 million.

She described the role as being the most physically demanding she had ever played, and confessed that while she thought of herself as being fit she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the demands of the role. Hathaway trained extensively in martial arts for the role, and looked to Hedy Lamarr—who was the inspiration for the Catwoman character—in developing her performance. Upon release ""The Dark Knight Rises"" received a positive critical response and grossed over $1.081 billion worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2012. Hathaway also won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Selina Kyle.

Christopher Orr from ""The Atlantic"" wrote that ""Hathaway gives it everything she has, beginning in quiet sorrow before building to a woebegone climax: she gasps, she weeps, she coughs. If you are blown away by the scene—as many will be—this may be the film for you."" Ann Hornaday of ""The Washington Post"" wrote that ""The centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway, who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers"". In January 2013, Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" reached number 69 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. In February 2013, it was officially announced by 20th Century Fox that Hathaway will reprise her role as Jewel in the animated film ""Rio 2"" set for release in the United States on April 11, 2014.

In June 2008, it was investigated by the IRS, for failure to file required nonprofit information forms. Citing concern that this investigation and other legal issues in which Follieri was involved could hurt her acting career, Hathaway ended their relationship in mid-June, 2008. Follieri was arrested on June 24, 2008, on charges of defrauding investors out of millions of dollars in a scheme in which Follieri posed as the Vatican's point man on real-estate investing. It was reported that the FBI confiscated Hathaway's private journals from Follieri's New York City apartment as part of their ongoing investigation into Follieri's activities; however, Hathaway was not charged with any crime. On October 23, 2008, after earlier pleading guilty, Follieri was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In November 2008, Hathaway began dating actor Adam Shulman. The couple became engaged in November 2011 and were married on September 29, 2012, in Big Sur, California in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service. Charity work and other interests.

In early 2007, Hathaway spoke of her experiences with depression during her teenage years, saying that she eventually overcame the disorder without medication. In 2008, on ""Late Show with David Letterman"", Hathaway said she had once again stopped smoking. The actress, who had begun smoking ""heavily"" while filming ""Rachel Getting Married"", had ""quit for a while"", but had started again in the wake of her stressful summer and the end of her relationship with Raffaello Follieri. She credited quitting smoking for the subsequent decline in her stress level, and declared her return to being vegetarian. She later became a vegan in early 2012.

France national football team," France national football team  The France national football team () represents France in international football. It is fielded by the French Football Federation (), the governing body of football in France, and competes as a member of UEFA, which encompasses the countries of Europe. The national team's traditional colours are blue, white and red, the colors of the national flag of France, known as the ""drapeau tricolore"", and the ""coq gaulois"" is the symbol of the team. France is colloquially known as ""Les Bleus"" (""The Blues""), which is the name associated with all of the country's sporting national teams, due to the blue shirts each team incorporates. France played its first official match in 1904, and today primarily plays its home matches at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris. The national team has won one FIFA World Cup title, two UEFA European Football Championships, an Olympic tournament, and two FIFA Confederations Cups. Following France's 2001 Confederations Cup victory, they became, along with Argentina, the only national teams to win the three most important men's titles organized by FIFA. France has a strong rivalry with neighbours Italy, and has historically also had important rivalries with Belgium, Brazil, England, Germany, and Spain. The national team has experienced much of its success during three major ""golden generations"": in the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s respectively, which resulted in numerous major honours. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and, although having been eliminated in the qualification stage six times, is one of only three teams that have entered every World Cup cycle. In 1958, the team, led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, finished in third place at the FIFA World Cup. In 1984, France, led by Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini, won UEFA Euro 1984. Under the leadership of Didier Deschamps and three-time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, France became one of eight national teams to win the FIFA World Cup in 1998 when it hosted the tournament. Two years later, the team triumphed again in UEFA Euro 2000 and became the top team in the FIFA World Rankings for the first time. France has since added a pair of Confederations Cup titles, in 2001 and 2003, as well as an appearance in the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which it lost 5–3 on penalties to Italy. Following the team's disastrous 2010 FIFA World Cup, where France failed to reach the knockout stages after a 2-0 loss to Mexico campaign, a major reconstruction within the federation resulted in the resignation of president Jean-Pierre Escalettes and the appointment of former international Laurent Blanc as manager, followed by Didier Deschamps in 2012. After dropping to 27th in the FIFA World Rankings in September 2010, its lowest ranking ever, France is currently ranked 23rd. After the victory of its U-20 youth squad at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. France became the first team in history to claim all five of FIFA's 11-player men's titles. Their latest triumph adds to their FIFA World Cup (1998), FIFA Confederation Cups (2001 and 2003), FIFA U-17 World Cup (2001) and Olympic gold medal (1984). France has also won all of UEFA's men championships (U-17, U-19, U-21 and senior-level) at least once. History. The France national football team was created in 1904 around the time of FIFA's foundation on 21 May 1904 and contested its first official international match on 1 May 1904 against Belgium, in Brussels, which ended in a 3–3 draw. The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first ever home match against Switzerland. The match was played at the Parc des Princes in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1–0 with the only goal coming from Gaston Cyprès. Due to disagreements between FIFA and the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA), the country's sports union, France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club's appearances in forthcoming Olympics Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the French Football Federation. In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the French Football Federation. In July 1930, France appeared in the inaugural FIFA World Cup, held in Uruguay. In their first-ever World Cup match, France defeated Mexico 4–1 at the Estadio Pocitos in Montevideo. Lucien Laurent became notable in the match as he scored not only France's first World Cup goal, but the first goal in World Cup history. France later lost 1–0 to fellow group stage opponents Argentina and Chile resulting in the team bowing out in the group stage. The following year saw the first selection of a black player to the national team. Raoul Diagne, who was of Senegalese descent, earned his first cap on 15 February in a 2–1 defeat to Czechoslovakia. Diagne later played with the team at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, alongside Larbi Benbarek, who was one of the first players of North African origin to play for the national team. At the 1934 FIFA World Cup, France suffered elimination in the opening round, losing 3–2 to Austria. On the team's return to Paris, they were greeted as heroes by a crowd of over 4,000 supporters. France hosted the 1938 FIFA World Cup and reached the quarter-finals losing 3–1 to the defending champions Italy. The 1950s saw France handed its first Golden Generation composed of players such as Just Fontaine, Raymond Kopa, Jean Vincent, Robert Jonquet, Maryan Wisnieski, Thadée Cisowski, and Armand Penverne. At the 1958 FIFA World Cup, France reached the semi-finals losing to Brazil. In the third place match, France defeated West Germany 6–2 with Fontaine recording four goals, which brought his goal tally in the competition to 13, a World Cup record. The record still stands today. France hosted the inaugural UEFA European Football Championship in 1960 and, for the second straight international tournament, reached the semi-finals. In the round, France faced Yugoslavia and were shocked 5–4 despite being up 4–2 heading into the 75th minute. In the third-place match, France were defeated 2–0 by the Czechoslovakians. The 1960s and 70s saw France decline significantly playing under several different managers and failing to qualify for numerous international tournaments. On 25 April 1964, Henri Guérin was officially installed as the team's first manager. Under Guérin, France failed to qualify for the 1962 FIFA World Cup and the 1964 European Nations' Cup. The team did return to major international play following qualification for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The team lost in the group stage portion of the tournament. Guérin was fired following the World Cup. He was replaced by José Arribas and Jean Snella, who worked as caretaker managers in dual roles. The two only lasted four matches and were replaced by former international Just Fontaine, who only lasted two. Louis Dugauguez succeeded Fontaine and, following his early struggles in qualification for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was fired and replaced by Georges Boulogne, who could not get the team to the competition. Boulogne was later fired following his failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and was replaced by the Romanian ?tefan Kovács, who became the only international manager to ever manage the national team. Kovács also turned out to be a disappointment failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1976. After two years in charge, he was sacked and replaced with Michel Hidalgo. Under Hidalgo, France flourished, mainly due to the accolades of great players like defenders Marius Trésor and Maxime Bossis, striker Dominique Rocheteau and of course midfielder Michel Platini, who, alongside Jean Tigana, Alain Giresse, and Luis Fernández formed the """"carré magique"""" (""Magic Square""), which would haunt opposing defenses beginning at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where France reached the semi-finals losing on penalties to rivals West Germany. The semi-final match-up is considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history and was marred with controversy. France earned their first major international honor two years later, winning UEFA Euro 1984, which they hosted. Under the leadership of Platini, who scored a tournament-high nine goals, France defeated Spain 2–0 in the final. Platini and Bruno Bellone scored the goals. Following the Euro triumph, Hidalgo departed the team and was replaced by former international Henri Michel. France later completed the hat-trick when they won gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics football tournament and, a year later, defeated Uruguay 2–0 to win the Artemio Franchi Trophy, an early precursor to the FIFA Confederations Cup. Dominique Rocheteau and José Touré scored the goals. In a span of a year, France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At the 1986 FIFA World Cup, France were favorites to win the competition, and, for the second consecutive World Cup, reached the semi-finals where they faced West Germany. Again, however, they lost. A 4–2 victory over Belgium gave France third place. In 1988, the French Football Federation opened the Clairefontaine National Football Institute. Its opening ceremony was attended by then-President of France, François Mitterrand. Five months after Clairefontaine's opening, manager Henri Michel was fired and was replaced by Michel Platini, who failed to get the team to the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Platini did lead the team to UEFA Euro 1992 and, despite going on a 19-match unbeaten streak prior to the competition, suffered elimination in the group stage. A week after the completion of the tournament, Platini stepped down as manager and was replaced by his assistant Gérard Houllier. Under Houllier, France and its supporters experienced a heartbreaking meltdown after having qualification to the 1994 FIFA World Cup all but secured with two matches to go, which were against last place Israel and Bulgaria. In the match against Israel, France were upset 3–2 and, in the Bulgaria match, suffered an astronomical 2–1 defeat. The subsequent blame and public outcry to the firing of Houllier and departure of several players from the national team fold. His assistant Aimé Jacquet was given his post. Under Jacquet, the national team experienced its triumphant years. The squad composed of veterans that failed to reach the 1994 FIFA World Cup were joined by influential youngsters. The team started off well reaching the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996 where they lost 6–5 on penalties to the Czech Republic. In the team's next major tournament at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Jacquet led France to glory defeating Brazil 3–0 in the final at the Stade de France. Jacquet stepped down after the country's World Cup triumph and was succeeded by assistant Roger Lemerre who guided them through UEFA Euro 2000. Led by FIFA World Player of the Year Zidane, France defeated Italy 2–1 in the final. Trezeguet scored the golden goal in extra time. The victory gave the team the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, and it was also the first time that a reigning World Cup winner went on to capture the Euro. Following the result, the French national team were inserted to the number one spot in the FIFA World Rankings. France failed to maintain that pace in subsequent tournaments. Although, the team won the Confederations Cup in 2001, France suffered a stunning goalless first round elimination at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. One of the greatest shocks in World Cup history saw France condemned to a 1–0 defeat to debutantes Senegal in the opening game of the tournament. After France finished bottom of the group, Lemerre was dismissed and was replaced by Jacques Santini. A full strength team started out strongly in UEFA Euro 2004, but they were upset in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners Greece. Santini resigned as coach and Raymond Domenech was picked as his replacement. France struggled in the early qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. This prompted Domenech to persuade several past members out of international retirement to help the national team qualify, which they accomplished following a convincing 4–0 win over Cyprus on the final day of qualifying. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, France finished undefeated in the group stage portion and advanced all the way to the final defeating the likes of Spain, Brazil, and Portugal along the way. France took on Italy in the final and despite controversial disruptions in extra time, France failed to get on the score-sheet and Italy won 5–3 on penalties to be crowned champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. France started its qualifying round for UEFA Euro 2008 strong and qualified for the tournament, despite two inevitable defeats to Scotland. France bowed out during the group stage portion of the tournament after having been placed in the group of death (which included Netherlands and Italy). Just like the team's previous World Cup qualifying campaign, the 2010 campaign got off to a disappointing start with France suffering disastrous losses and earning uninspired victories. France eventually finished second in the group and earned a spot in the UEFA play-offs against the Republic of Ireland for a place in South Africa. In the first leg, France defeated the Irish 1–0 and in the second leg procured a 1–1 draw, via controversial circumstances, to qualify for the World Cup. In the 2010 FIFA World Cup, France continued to perform under expectations and were eliminated in the group stage. Midway through the competition, striker Nicolas Anelka was dismissed from the national team after reportedly having a dispute, in which obscenities were passed, with team manager Raymond Domenech during half-time of the team's loss to Mexico. The resulting disagreement over Anelka's explusion between the players, the coaching staff, and federation officials resulted in the team boycotting training. The negative publicity the national team received during the competition led to further repercussions back in France. The day after the team's elimination, it was reported by numerous media outlets that the President of France Nicolas Sarkozy would meet with team captain Thierry Henry to discuss the issues associated with the team's meltdown at the World Cup. The meeting was requested by Henry. Following the completion of the competition, federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes resigned from his position. Domenech was also let go and former international Laurent Blanc was inserted as his replacement. On 23 July 2010, on the request of Blanc, the federation suspended all 23 players in the World Cup squad for the team's friendly match against Norway after the World Cup. On 6 August, five players who were deemed to have played a major role in the 2010 FIFA World Cup training boycott were disciplined for their roles. Home stadium. During France's early years, the team's national stadium alternated between the Parc des Princes in Paris and the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. France also hosted matches at the Stade Pershing, Stade de Paris, and the Stade Buffalo, but to a minimal degree. As the years moved forward, France began hosting matches outside the city of Paris at such venues as the Stade Marcel Saupin in Nantes, the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, and the Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg. Following the renovation of the Parc des Princes in 1972, which gave the stadium the largest capacity in Paris, France moved into the venue permanently. The team still hosted friendly matches and minor FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship qualification matches at other venues. In 1998, the Stade de France was inaugurated as France's national stadium ahead of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Located in Saint-Denis, a Parisian suburb, the stadium has an all-seater capacity of 81,338. France's first match at the stadium was played on 28 January 1998 against Spain. France won the match 1–0, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the lone goal. Since that match, France has used the stadium for almost every major home game. Prior to matches, home or away, the national team trains at the Clairefontaine academy in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines. Clairefontaine is the national association football centre and is among twelve élite academies throughout the country. The center was inaugurated in 1976 by former federation president Fernand Sastre and opened in 1988. The center drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Team image. Media coverage. The national team currently has a broadcasting agreement with TF1 Group, who control the country's main national TV channel, TF1. The current agreement was set to expire following the 2010 FIFA World Cup. On 18 December 2009, the Federal Council of the French Football Federation agreed to extend its exclusive broadcasting agreement with the channel. The new deal grants the channel exclusive broadcast rights for the matches of national team, which include friendlies and international games for the next four seasons beginning in August 2010 and ending in June 2014. TF1 will also have extended rights, notably on the Internet, and may also broadcast images of the national team in its weekly program, Téléfoot. The federation will receive €45 million a season, a €10 million decrease from the €55 million they received from the previous agreement reached in 2006. Kit. The France national team utilizes a three colour system, composed of colors blue, white and red. The team's three colors originate from the national flag of France, known as the ""drapeau tricoleur"". France have brandished the colors since their first official international match against Belgium in 1904. Since the team's inception, France normally wear blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks at home, while, when on the road, the team utilizes an all-white combination or wear red shirts, blue shorts, and blue socks with the former being the most current. Between the years 1909–1914, France wore a white shirt with blue stripes, white shorts, and red socks. In a 1978 World Cup match against Hungary in Mar del Plata, both teams arrived at Estadio José María Minella with white kits, so France played in green-and-white striped shirts borrowed from Club Atlético Kimberley. Beginning in 1966, France had its shirts made by Le Coq Sportif until 1972. In 1972, France reached an agreement with German sports apparel manufacturer Adidas to be the team's kit provider. Over the next 38 years, the two would maintain a healthy relationship with France winning UEFA Euro 1984, the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2000 while wearing the brand's famous tricolour three stripes. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, France wore an all-white change strip in all four of its knockout matches, including the final. On 22 February 2008, the French Football Federation announced that they were ending their partnership with Adidas and signing with the American manufacturer Nike, effective 1 January 2011. The unprecedented deal is valued at €320 million over seven years (2011–2018) making France's blue shirt the most expensive ever in the history of football. The first France kit worn in a major tournament produced by Nike was the UEFA Euro 2012 strip, which was all dark blue and used gold as an accent colour. In February 2013, Nike revealed an all baby blue change strip. "
Cristiano Ronaldo," Cristiano Ronaldo  Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, OIH, (born 5 February 1985), commonly known as Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish La Liga club Real Madrid and who serves as captain of the Portuguese national team. He became the most expensive footballer in history on his 2009 move from Manchester United to Real Madrid in a transfer worth £80 million (€94 million/$131.6 million), a record that would later be reportedly broken by Gareth Bale, who joined Real Madrid in 2013 for £85 million (€100 million). In addition, Ronaldo's contract with Real Madrid, under the terms of which he is paid €21 million per year (after taxes), makes him the highest-paid footballer in the world, and his buyout clause is valued at €1 billion as per his contract. Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, before moving to C.D. Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal. Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who signed him for £12.24 million (€15 million) in 2003. The following season, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup. Ronaldo was the first player playing in England to win all four main PFA and FWA awards, doing so in 2007. In 2008, Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or. He placed second in the Ballon d'Or in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012. He was awarded the European Golden Shoe in both 2008 and 2011. In 2008, he won three of the four main PFA and FWA trophies and was named the FIFPro Player of the Year, World Soccer Player of the Year, Onze d'Or, and the FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2007 and 2008, Ronaldo was named FWA Footballer of the Year. Ronaldo was the inaugural winner of the FIFA Puskás Award for the Goal of the Year in 2009. Ronaldo is regarded to be one of the two best footballers in today's game and has the potential to be one of the greatest of all time. Ronaldo is the first top European league player to reach 40 goals in a single season in two consecutive years, fastest Real Madrid player to reach one hundred league goals, and the first player ever to score against every team in a single season in La Liga. He also holds records for most goals scored in a season for Real Madrid and most goals scored per minute in La Liga for a Real Madrid player. In January 2013, Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 300th club goal. Ronaldo is a Portuguese international and made his debut against Kazakhstan in August 2003. He has been capped over 100 times and is his country's second-highest goalscorer of all time. With Portugal he has participated in five major tournaments; UEFA Euro 2004, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He scored his first international goal in the opening game of the Euro 2004 against Greece, in addition to helping Portugal reach the final. He took over the captaincy of the side in July 2008 and went on to captain Portugal to the semi-finals at the Euro 2012 and finished the competition as the joint best scorer with three goals. Early life. Ronaldo was born in Santo António, a neighbourhood of Funchal, Madeira, the youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener. His second given name ""Ronaldo"" was chosen after then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan, who was his father's favourite actor. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia. His great-grandmother Isabel da Piedade was from Cape Verde. The family was staunchly Catholic and lived in poverty. Ronaldo had no toys and shared a room with his brother and sisters. Ronaldo was popular with other students at school, but he was expelled after he threw a chair at his teacher. Ronaldo later said of the incident: ""He disrespected me."" At the age of 14, Ronaldo agreed with his mother to then focus entirely on football. Club career. Early career. At the age of eight, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha, where his father was the kit man. In 1995, Ronaldo signed with local club Nacional, and, after a title-winning campaign, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who subsequently signed him for an undisclosed sum. Sporting Clube de Portugal. Ronaldo joined Sporting's other youth players who trained at the Academia Sporting, the club's football academy, in Alcochete. He became the only player ever to play for Sporting's under-16, under-17, under-18, B-team, and the first team, all within one season. He scored two goals in his league debut on 7 October 2002, which Sporting CP won 3–0 against Moreirense, while featuring for Portugal in the 2002 European Under-17 Championship. At the age of 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that might have forced him to give up playing football. The Sporting staff were made aware of the condition and Ronaldo's mother gave her authorisation for him to go into hospital. While there, he had an operation in which a laser was used to cauterise the area of his heart that was causing the problem. The surgery took place in the morning and Ronaldo was discharged from hospital by the end of the afternoon; he resumed training only a few days later. In November 2002, Ronaldo was invited to Arsenal's training ground, London Colney to meet manager Arsène Wenger and his coaching staff. Wenger, who was interested in signing the midfielder had arranged to meet Ronaldo's representatives, Formation (who suggested the player originally to Gérard Houllier, then Liverpool's manager) in the subsequent months to discuss a transfer arrangement. However he came to the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in the summer of 2003, when Sporting defeated United 3–1 in the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in Lisbon. Ronaldo's performance impressed the Manchester United players, who urged Ferguson to sign him. Ronaldo was offered to Barcelona for less than the €15 million Manchester United paid, but the Catalan club could not afford him at the time as the club had already spent its budget on other players. On April 2013, Ronaldo was honoured by Sporting as the club announced that the player had become their 100,000th member. Manchester United. 2003–2006. Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed for €15 million (£12.24 million) after the 2002–03 season. He requested the number 28 (his number at Sporting), as he did not want the pressure of living up to the expectation linked to the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by players such as George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, and David Beckham. ""After I joined, the manager asked me what number I'd like. I said 28. But Ferguson said 'No, you're going to have No. 7,' and the famous shirt was an extra source of motivation. I was forced to live up to such an honour."" Ronaldo made his team debut as a 60th-minute substitute in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers. He scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November 2003. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 FA Cup final victory over Millwall. He scored United's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2005 in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough. He scored ten goals in all competitions, and fans voted him to his first FIFPro Special Young Player of the Year award in 2005. He was sent off in the Manchester derby at the City of Manchester Stadium on 14 January 2006 (a game which United lost 3–1) for kicking City's former United player Andrew Cole. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football in the 2005–06 season, scoring the third goal in Manchester United's 4–0 Football League Cup final victory over Wigan Athletic. 2006–2009. The 2006–2007 season proved to be the breakout year for Ronaldo, as he broke the 20 goal barrier for the first time and picked up his first league title with Manchester United. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by Rene Meulensteen. Meulenstein coached him in moves to make himself more unpredictable. He also helped him to work better with his team-mates, calling for the ball and scoring more 'ugly' goals instead of waiting for the special occasion when he could score the 'beautiful' goals for which he was already famous. In November and December 2006, Ronaldo received consecutive Barclays Player of the Month honours, becoming only the third player in Premier League history to do so after Dennis Bergkamp in 1997 and Robbie Fowler in 1996. He scored his 50th Manchester United goal against city rivals Manchester City on 5 May 2007 as United claimed their first Premier League title in four years, and he was voted into his second consecutive FIFPro Special Young Player of the Year award at the end of the year. Despite rumours circulating in March 2007 that Real Madrid were willing to pay an unprecedented €80 million (£54 million) for Ronaldo, he signed a five-year, £120,000-a-week (£31 million total) extension with United on 13 April, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Ronaldo amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year awards, joining Andy Gray (in 1977) as the only players to receive this honour. In April, he completed the treble by winning the PFA Fans' Player of the Year. He also won the PFA Fans' Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of the Year, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA awards. Ronaldo was also one of eight Manchester United players named in the 2006–07 PFA Premier League Team of the Year. Ronaldo's 2007–08 season began with a red card for a headbutt on Portsmouth player Richard Hughes during United's second match of the season, for which he was punished with a three-match ban. Ronaldo said he had ""learned a lot"" from the experience and would not let players ""provoke"" him in the future. After scoring the only goal in a Champions League away match against Sporting, Ronaldo also scored the injury-time winner in the return fixture as Manchester United topped their Champions League group. He finished as the runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and was third in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi. Ronaldo scored his first hat trick for Manchester United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United at Old Trafford on 12 January 2008, bringing Manchester United up to the top of the Premier League table. He scored his twenty-third league goal of the season in a 2–0 win against Reading, equalling his entire total for the 2006–07 season. During a 1–1 Champions League first knockout round draw against Lyon on 20 February, an unidentified Lyon supporter continuously aimed a green laser at Ronaldo and United teammate Nani, prompting an investigation by UEFA. One month later, Lyon were fined CHF5,000 (£2,427) for the incident. On 19 March 2008, Ronaldo captained United for the first time in his career in a home win over Bolton, scoring both goals in the 2–0 victory. The second of the goals was his 33rd of the campaign, which set a new club single-season scoring record by a midfielder and thus topped George Best's forty-year-old total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season. Ronaldo scored another brace in a 4–0 win over Aston Villa on 29 March, which at the time gave him 35 goals in 37 domestic and European matches as both a starter and substitute. Ronaldo's scoring streak was rewarded with his becoming the first winger to win the 2007–08 European Golden Shoe, finishing eight points ahead of Mallorca's Dani Güiza. In the 2007–08 Champions League final on 21 May against league rivals Chelsea, Ronaldo scored the opening goal after 26 minutes, which was negated by a Chelsea equaliser in the 45th minute as the match ended 1–1 after extra time. His misfire in the penalty shoot-out put Chelsea in position to win the trophy, but John Terry shot wide right after slipping on the pitch surface, and Manchester United emerged victorious 6–5 on penalties. Ronaldo was named the UEFA Fans' Man of the Match, and wrapped up the campaign with a career-high 42 goals in all competitions, falling four short of Denis Law's team-record mark of 46 in the 1963–64 season. In the Champions League he was also named best forward and player of the tournament and was the competition's top goalscorer. On 5 June 2008, Sky Sports reported that Ronaldo had expressed an interest in moving to Real Madrid if they offered him the same amount of money the team had allegedly promised him earlier in the year. Manchester United filed a tampering complaint with FIFA on 9 June over Madrid's alleged pursuit of Ronaldo, but FIFA declined to take any action. Speculation that a transfer would happen continued until 6 August, when Ronaldo confirmed that he would stay at United for at least another year. Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam on 7 July. He returned to action on 17 September in United's goalless UEFA Champions League group stage draw with Villarreal as a substitute for Park Ji-Sung, and scored his first goal of the season in a 3–1 League Cup third round win over Middlesbrough on 24 September. In a 5–0 win over Stoke City on 15 November 2008, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st goals in all competitions for Manchester United, both from free kicks. The goals also meant that Ronaldo had now scored against each of the other 19 teams in the Premier League at the time. On 2 December, Ronaldo became Manchester United's first Ballon d'Or recipient since George Best in 1968. He finished with 446 points, 165 ahead of runner-up Lionel Messi. He was awarded the Silver Ball after finishing with two goals as United won the Club World Cup on 19 December. On 8 January 2009, Ronaldo was uninjured in a single-car accident in which he wrote off his Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano in a tunnel along the A538 near Manchester Airport. A breathalyser test he gave to police officers at the scene was negative, and he attended training later that morning. Four days later, he became the first Premier League player ever to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year, in addition to being the first Portuguese player to win the award since Luís Figo in 2001. Ronaldo scored his first Champions League goal of the season, and first since the final against Chelsea, in a 2–0 victory over Internazionale that sent United into the quarter-finals. In the second leg against Porto, Ronaldo scored a 40-yard game-winning goal as United advanced to the semi-finals. For this goal Ronaldo holds the distinction of being the first player to win the FIFA Puskás Award, in 2009, an honour handed by FIFA to the best goal of the year. He later called it the best goal he had ever scored. Ronaldo participated in his second consecutive Champions League final, but made little impact in United's 2–0 loss to Barcelona. He finished with 53 appearances in all competitions, which was four higher than the previous year, but scored sixteen fewer goals (26) than his career-best total of 42 from the previous season. On 11 June, Manchester United accepted an unconditional offer of £80 million from Real Madrid for Ronaldo after it was revealed that he again had expressed his desire to leave the club. It was confirmed by a representative of the Glazer family that the sale was fully condoned by Ferguson. When Ronaldo had eventually completed his transfer to Real, he expressed his gratitude towards Ferguson for helping him develop as a player, saying, ""He's been my father in sport, one of the most important factors and most influential in my career.""

Ronaldo's contract is worth €11 million per year and it has a €1 billion buy-out clause. He was presented to the world media as a Real Madrid player on 6 July, where he was handed the number 9 jersey. The shirt was presented to him by Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stéfano. Ronaldo was welcomed by between 80,000 and 85,000 fans at his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, surpassing Diego Maradona's record of 75,000 fans when he was presented in Italy, after he was transferred from Barcelona to Napoli in 1984. The event was broadcast live on the Spanish and Portuguese public TV stations, RTVE and RTP respectively. Ronaldo made his Madrid debut on 21 July in a 1–0 win over Shamrock Rovers. His first goal came one week later with a penalty in Madrid's 4–2 win over LDU Quito. On 29 August, Ronaldo capped his La Liga debut with a goal, scoring Real's second from the penalty spot in a 3–2 home win against Deportivo La Coruña. On 15 September, Ronaldo scored two free-kicks in a 5–2 away victory over Zürich, his first Champions League goals for Real. He broke a Madrid club record when he scored in a league match against Villarreal and thus became the first ever player to score in his first four La Liga appearances. An ankle injury suffered on 10 October, while Ronaldo was on international duty with Portugal against Hungary, kept him out until 25 November, which in turn caused him to miss both of Madrid's Champions League group stage matches against Milan. Ronaldo made his first post-injury start in a 1–0 ""El Clásico"" defeat to Barcelona on 29 November. On 6 December, he was sent off for the first time in his Madrid career during Real's 4–2 victory against Almería, a match which also saw him miss a penalty.

On 23 October 2010, Ronaldo scored four goals against Racing de Santander, the most goals he has ever scored in a single match. This completed a goalscoring run of six consecutive matches (three in La Liga, one in the Champions League, and two for Portugal) in which Ronaldo scored in each match, totalling 11 goals, which is the most Ronaldo has scored in a single month. Before Real Madrid's 5–0 defeat by Barcelona at the Camp Nou, Ronaldo scored his second La Liga hat-trick of the season in a 5–1 win over Athletic Bilbao. His final match of the calendar year saw him score a hat-trick in a 8–0 trashing of Levante in the Copa del Rey. Ronaldo began the 2011 with a very promising outlook, especially after Real Madrid acknowledged he had broken numerous goalscoring records, previously settled and held by classic players such as Alfredo Di Stéfano, Hugo Sánchez, and Manuel Alday. Ronaldo began his scoring spree by scoring two vital goals in a tight 3–2 victory away to Getafe. He then consolidated his massive performances by scoring a hat-trick and assisting Kaká to score his first league goal after his return from injury, in a 4–2 victory over Villarreal on 9 January. On 3 March 2011, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 7–0 trashing of Málaga, but was affected by a muscle injury at the end of the match, which forced him to spend 10 days on the sidelines. In April he made another massive comeback from injury, sustaining a three-game scoring streak (including 2 goals in Champions League quarter-finals against Tottenham Hotspur), thus arriving to the first of a historical series of four El Clásico encounters two goals short of breaking his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions in a single season, achieved at Manchester United in the 2007–08 season.

On 20 April, Ronaldo scored the winning goal against Barcelona in the 103rd minute of the Copa del Rey final. This goal would later be chosen as both Ronaldo's and Real Madrid's best goal in the season by several fan polls, including those of Marca and Real Madrid's website. 7 May saw Real travel to the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán to take on Sevilla, where Ronaldo led the thrashing of the Andalusian side, scoring four goals in a 6–2 victory. These four goals took him to 46 for the season which surpassed his previous record of 42 in a season playing for Manchester United. Three days later he reached 49 goals for the season, by scoring another hat-trick in a 4–0 home win against Getafe. On 15 May, after scoring two free-kick goals in a 3–1 win over Villarreal, he equalled the La Liga record with most goals in a season with 38, a record previously held by Telmo Zarra and Hugo Sánchez.

By doing this, he won the European Golden Shoe award once again, becoming the first player to win the trophy in two different leagues. The sports newspaper ""Marca"", who awards the Pichichi Trophy, included the goal scored on 18 September 2010 against Real Sociedad in Ronaldo's goal count, which had been officially attributed to Pepe. Should this goal be granted to Ronaldo, his goal count in the Pichichi Trophy would tally 41 goals. Ronaldo also broke Zarra's record of most goals per minute, with a goal scored every 70.7 minutes. However, regardless of this goal polemic, Ronaldo's record-breaking figures became a source of major attention from public media, such as being included in the ""Sports Illustrated"" World XI, rating him as one of the world's best footballers. Accounting for all competitions, Ronaldo ended the season with a total of 53 goals (not granting him the controversial goal from Pepe), having scored 25 goals with his right foot (excluding free-kicks and penalty-kicks) and 9 with his left foot.

On 17 August 2011, Ronaldo scored his 100th goal with Real Madrid with a first-half equaliser against Barcelona in the second leg of the 2011 Spanish Supercup in the Camp Nou. On 27 August 2011, he opened the 2011–12 La Liga season with a hat-trick in a 6–0 win at Real Zaragoza.

The English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced referee Horacio Elizondo's decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at the Portuguese bench following Rooney's dismissal. After the match, Ronaldo insisted that Rooney was a friend and that he was not pushing for Rooney to be sent off. On 4 July, Elizondo clarified that the red card was due to Rooney's infraction and not the fracas between Rooney and Ronaldo that followed. The angry reaction from the English press caused Ronaldo to consider leaving United, and he allegedly told Spanish sports daily ""Marca"" that he wished to move to Real Madrid.

Cristiano Ronaldo's team-mate, Nani, later defended him, stating that he had left the pitch as he needed to instantly be treated for a possible injury. He also stated that Ronaldo had been training well and contributing greatly to the team, also adding that he was under excessive pressure, as football is a team sport. Nani finally stated that he believed that Cristiano Ronaldo would soon silence his critics. Luís Figo, however, criticised Cristiano Ronaldo's behaviour, stating that it is the captain's responsibility to always defend the group, despite the result. During the match between Denmark and Portugal, the Denmark fans chanted Lionel Messi's name whenever Ronaldo was on the ball. Ronaldo squandered two gilt-edged one-on-one chances, and Ronaldo looked frustrated and tormented throughout. Asked about the Messi chants, Ronaldo responded irritatedly: ""You know where he was at this time last year? Do you know? He was being eliminated in the Copa America, in his own country. I think that's worse, no? And people say that he is the best player in the world. This sort of thing is normal for great players."" In the final group match between Portugal and the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored two goals to secure a 2–1 victory for Portugal, allowing them to advance to the quarterfinals.

The Portugal coach, Paulo Bento, knocked back criticism of Cristiano Ronaldo not being employed earlier in the shootout. ""Well we had this plan and if it would have been 4–4 and he would have taken the last penalty we would talk in a different way,"" Bento said. Before and throughout the tournament, Ronaldo was particularly hailed by Diego Maradona who even declared Ronaldo as ""the best player on the planet"" and that ""has shown his countrymen that he does deserve a monument in Lisbon.""

With his goals against North Ireland, Ronaldo also established a personal record, since it was the first time that he scored in three consecutive matches with Portugal. Style of play. Widely regarded as one of the two best players in the world and as one of the best players to ever play the game, Cristiano Ronaldo plays an attacking role, most often playing as either a striker or as a winger, and is known for his finishing, pace, dribbling, positioning and his passing and crossing ability. He is able to play on either wing as well through the center of the pitch, making him a very versatile attacker. Tactically, Ronaldo plays a powerful attacking role, often drifting from the left wing into the centre when moving off the ball. Ronaldo is known to be mentally sharp, with good vision, predicting certain plays, and also possesses very good reactions, balance and agility. Although right footed, he is also able to control the ball and cross and finish well with his left foot. Cristiano Ronaldo is known for his pace, skill, control and dribbling ability, as well as his flair in beating players during one on one situations. He is able to finish well both inside the area and from distance. He is also an accurate set piece and penalty kick specialist. Uniquely, his height, strength, jumping ability and heading technique have given him an edge in winning aerial challenges for balls, with the majority of his goals often being headers. Since his arrival at Manchester United, Ronaldo underwent a major body transformation, from a skinny youth to an athletically built adult. His well-built, muscular body type allows him to keep his balance when protecting the ball. Both Manchester United's strength and conditioning coach Mike Clegg, and French legend Zinedine Zidane have praised Ronaldo's incredible work ethic and dedication to improvement on the training field and have stated that he has been renowned for this. Ronaldo said: ""I didn't have any particular idols as a child. My ambition was to play for my national team because that's where the footballers I mostly followed played. I'm sure I used to do stuff I no longer do due to age or experience."" Ronaldo once stated his desire to carve his name in history alongside footballing legends such as Pelé and Diego Maradona, and that he would rather be remembered as a role model than one of world football's best players. However, Ronaldo has at times been criticised for some of his performances in the national team, on which Maradona has commented: ""As good as he is with Real Madrid, he often seems frustrated on the national level, as if he was surrounded by players who do little to assist him."" Ronaldo also has been criticised for his diving when tackled. For which José Mourinho has told: ""Cristiano is a player who does not have the culture of the swimming pool, he has no culture of simulation, he is a British-trained player, Ferguson trained. In some cases, the simulators are given more protection, and those who are honest are often the losers. I'm not a hypocrite if I say that they (defenders) hit Cristiano very hard, and that the yellow cards do not arrive or are slow in coming."" However, Mourinho suggested that Ronaldo does not take criticism well. Ronaldo has been described as having an ""arrogant image"" on the field of play with Ronaldo stating that he has become a ""victim"", because of how he is portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory. Ronaldo has insisted that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance declaring ""I was in the swimming pool with my girlfriend and sometimes we like to have a race. Sometimes you have to give her an opportunity to be happy but I win because I don't like to lose. It's simple like that."" Former Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who coached Ronaldo between 2003 and 2008, admitted that people are ""jealous"" of him. Compatriot Pepe slammed Ronaldo's ""arrogant image"", and instead highlighted his ""character"" and ""desire to win"". Ronaldo's direct football style, skill and goalscoring ability have been his most noticeable traits throughout his career, and his overall talent has at times led him to be considered a player who stands out and who can be a match changer. Ronaldo's increasing reputation led the media to draw comparisons between him and FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, which Ronaldo has commented on saying: ""Some people say I'm better, other people say it's him, but at the end of the day, they're going to decide who is the best player. Sometimes it makes me tired. For him too because they compare us together all the time. You cannot compare a Ferrari with a Porsche because it's a different engine. You cannot compare them. He does the best things for Barcelona, I do the best things for Madrid. I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high."" However, some former great players have criticised the comparison, such as Brazilian legend Pelé and Portuguese international Luis Figo, who cited that they have different playing styles. Though the comparison has been criticised, many former and current football players have cited Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the world's finest players. Former Brazilian star Roberto Carlos suggested that ""...Ronaldo can do much more for Madrid than Messi can for Barcelona. Madrid really depend on Ronaldo to perform well, while Barcelona are so much more than Messi."" Former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba even labelled the duo as ""monsters"" for revolutionising statistics for goals scored. Ronaldo's former Real Madrid manager, José Mourinho, once stated: ""If both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were born in different eras, they would have ruled the football scene and collected 10 FIFA Ballon d'Ors each."" Outside football. Personal life. Ronaldo's father, José Dinis Aveiro, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at the age of 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20. Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol and he received libel damages over a ""Daily Mirror"" article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. In October 2005, a month after his father died, Ronaldo was arrested on suspicion of raping a woman in a London hotel and released on bail. Ronaldo denied the allegations and charges were dropped by Scotland Yard in November 2005 due to ""insufficient evidence"". Ronaldo issued a statement saying: ""I have always strongly maintained my innocence of any wrong-doing and I am glad that this matter is at an end so that I can concentrate on playing for Manchester United."" Ronaldo announced that he had become a father on 3 July 2010. His official Facebook and Twitter pages reference the birth of his son and request privacy. The child, named Cristiano is in full custody of Ronaldo. Ronaldo has previously dated English models Alice Goodwin and Gemma Atkinson, and since the start of 2010, he has been dating Russian model Irina Shayk. He is a practising Roman Catholic. Philanthropy. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a No. 7 Portuguese football jersey who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against ""The Sun"" newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre in his native island Madeira. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between the Primeira Liga club FC Porto and players from Madeiran based clubs Marítimo and Nacional. In November 2011, Ronaldo donated a pair of his football boots to be auctioned by Real Madrid's 'Clasico' network. They were sold for £2050 with the proceeds going to fund schools in Gaza, Palestine. In May 2012, Ronaldo and his agent, Jorge Mendes, decided to fund a pioneering treatment for a nine-year-old boy when it seemed that there was no hope left for the child, who has been battling cancer since before his second birthday. In November 2012, Ronaldo sold the golden boot he had won in 2011 for €1.5 million and gave the money to fund schools for children in Gaza. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.

Arsenal F.C.," Arsenal F.C. strip  Arsenal Football Club (often simply known as Arsenal or The Arsenal, or by their nickname The Gunners) is an English professional football club founded in 1886 and based in Holloway, North London. Arsenal play in the Premier League and are one of the most successful clubs in English football. The club have moved location; founded in Woolwich, south-east London, in 1913 they moved north across the city to Arsenal Stadium, in Highbury. In 2006 they made a shorter move, to the Emirates Stadium. Similarly, the club's badge and colours, traditionally red and white, have evolved over time. This article describes the evolution of the Arsenal strip along the years. Colours. Home colours. For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops. For the 1895–96 season Arsenal would briefly play in blue and red striped shirt before reverting to dark red shirts the next season. The strip would remain mostly unchanged for the next 36 years, only the socks alterning from navy blue to dark red and back to navy blue again. In 1933 Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless jumper over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Dark blue socks would remain part of the Arsenal strip until the 1960–61 season when they were changed to white with red turnovers, thus creating the combination of red and white shirt, white short, white and red socks that is most familiar to Arsenal fans today. The red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe. In the 2010–11 season they reverted to all white sleeves Away colours. For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. For the 1950 FA Cup Final, Arsenal wore gold shirts. For five years between 1953 and 1958 the club's away shirt was royal blue with white sleeves. An all white kit would be used for the next nine years, between 1958 and 1967. Since the 1969–70 season, Arsenal have worn yellow and blue, to the extent that these are seen as their ""traditional"" away colours. There have been exceptions, however, such as the green and navy away kit worn in 1982–83. Since the early 1990s and the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away colours have been changed regularly. During this period the designs have been either two-tone blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, and the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007. As of 2009, the away kit is changed every season, and the outgoing away kit becomes the third-choice kit. Inspiration for other clubs. Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's coach returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of ""Os Arsenalistas"". These teams still wear these designs to this day. Shirt badge. FA Cup final badges. Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a monogram of the club's initials in red on a white background. The Art Deco badge. The monogram theme was developed into an Art Deco-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors. The Cannon. From 1967, a badge was used on the shirt for every game. The first badge was a white cannon facing left. In 1978 the cannon was slightly modified and the A-F-C cannonballs were added. Victoria Concordia Crescit. In 1990 the cannon badge was replaced with the ""Victoria Concordia Crescit"" crest. The crest was modified in 1994, and again in 1996, with the addition of the nickname ""The Gunners"". In 2001, the logo was simplified. The new badge. Because the Victoria Concordia Crescit had been heavily modified along the years the club was unable to copyright it. As a result a new copyrighted badge was commissioned and used as part of the club's identity from 2002. A major difference between the new badge and previous club crests is that the cannon now points to the right, whereas it previously pointed left. Arsenal also used a crest, similar to the 2002 shirt badge, to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary, with 15 laurel leaves on the left to reflect the pattern on a six-pence piece used to pay for a leather football, and 15 oak leaves on the right to reflect the 15 founding members of the club and their meeting place – the Royal Oak public house. Numbers. History. The first time numbers were used in association football was 25 August 1928, when Arsenal and Chelsea played in numbered shirts. Numbers were traditionally assigned based on a player's position on the field, with the starting 11 players wearing 1–11, (starting numerically with the goalkeeper wearing number 1), and the substitutes wearing higher numbers. Persistent squad number. In 1993 The Football Association (FA) switched to persistent squad numbers, abandoning the mandatory use of 1–11 for the starting line-up. The first league event to feature this was the 1993 Football League Cup Final between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday in April, and then again in the 1993 FA Cup Final at the tail end of the 1992–93 season, which was also contested by Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday. Persistent squad numbering became standard in the Premier League at the start of the 1993–94 season in August, along with names printed above the numbers. Most European top leagues adopted the system over the next five years. During this time English clubs continued to use the mandatory 1–11 for European matches. Retired numbers. As of 2013, no number has been retired by Arsenal. "
Radamel Falcao," Radamel Falcao  Radamel Falcao García Zárate (; 10 February 1986), commonly known simply as Radamel Falcao or Falcao García in South America, is a Colombian football striker, who currently plays for AS Monaco in the French Ligue 1 and represents the Colombia national football team. He is sometimes nicknamed as ""El Tigre"" (Spanish for ""The Tiger"") and ""King of the Europa League"". Falcao is considered by many experts to be the 'deadliest' striker in the world and among the best, having surpassed Jürgen Klinsmann's record of 15 goals (17) in a single annual club football European competition UEFA Champions League/UEFA Europa League campaign. He also played a key role in guiding F.C. Porto to a second UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League title, as well as finishing undefeated in the 2010–11 Primeira Liga season. In July 2011, Falcao was regarded as the fifth best player in Europe during the 2010–11 season through balloting by 53 sportswriters of the UEFA member associations. Falcao had also received the Portuguese Golden Ball award in 2011, becoming the first Colombian to do so. Falcao had won both the GQ Spain award for sportsman of the year and the Globe Best Footballer in 2012. In 2012, Falcao was listed 6th in ""The 100 best footballers in the world"" by ""The Guardian"". Falcao was listed into the FIFA XI for 2012. In just his first three seasons in European football, Falcao scored over 100 goals. Falcao had played a key role in Atlético Madrid's 12 match winning streak in a single Europa League season, making it the first team to do so. He also became the top goal scorer in both tournaments. Falcao had another historical achievement winning his first UEFA Super Cup in 2012, becoming the first player in history to score a hat trick in the contest since its reform in 1998. Falcao's most noticeable trait aside from his ability to play well with both feet and a strong header despite his size would be his impressive goal ratio and goal-by-minute ratio that even exceeds world top players Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. On 9 December 2012, Falcao became one of the few players in La Liga history to score five goals in one game after accomplishing this in a 6–0 home victory against Deportivo de La Coruña. In the 2013 Copa del Rey Final, Falcao played a very crucial part in Atlético Madrid's victory over Real Madrid, ending the 14 year unbeaten streak which Real Madrid had held in matches against Atlético prior to the final. Club career. Early career. Lanceros. Falcao made his debut for Lanceros Boyacá in the Colombian Categoría Primera B (second tier) on 28 August 1999 at the age of 13 years and 199 days, thus becoming the youngest debutant at that level of Colombian professional football. In 2000, Lanceros' coach, Hernán Pacheco, began to consider the 14-year-old more seriously; Falcao played seven matches that year. On 25 July, at the Estadio Olímpico del Sol at Sogamoso, he scored his first and only goal for the club, to seal a 2–0 win against Club El Cóndor that took Lanceros off the bottom of the table. In his two years with the club, he played eight matches and scored once. River Plate. After training with Millonarios, who did not take up their option to purchase the player, Falcao was sold to River Plate of Argentina in February 2001 for a $500,000 fee (which fell to $175,000 when the Argentine currency was devalued). He began his River career in the youth team, playing in the eighth division of Argentine football. River coach Leonardo Astrada gave Falcao his professional debut in the 2005 Torneo Clausura in a game that the club lost 2–1 to Gimnasia. Falcao became a regular in the first team during the 2005 Torneo Apertura. He scored twice in a match for the first time in Argentina, on 2 October in a game against Independiente that finished as a 3–1 win for River. He repeated the feat twice more during the Apertura: against Lanús, his brace contributed to a 4–1 home win, and against San Lorenzo, River won 5–1. This brought his total for the competition to seven from as many games under the management of Reinaldo Merlo, who gave Falcao the trust he needed to establish himself in the team. In the match against San Lorenzo in November, Falcao injured the ligaments of his right knee and missed the remainder of the Apertura; then, during pre-season training in January 2006, he sustained more serious damage to the same knee, which required surgery and was expected to keep him out for at least six months. He returned to the field in September, soon after the start of the 2006 Torneo Apertura, in which he made 12 appearances, mainly as a substitute; he scored just once, to seal a 2–0 win against Rosario Central that took River clear at the top of the table. A few days earlier he made his debut in CONMEBOL competition, in the last eight of the 2006 Copa Sudamericana against Atlético Paranaense of Brazil. He was replaced at half-time, and the match finished 2–2, so River were eliminated on aggregate, having lost the home leg 1–0. He was sent off in his only outing in the 2007 Copa Libertadores, against Colo-Colo in February 2007. Domestically, he made little impression on the 2007 Torneo Clausura. He scored in only one of the eight games he played: River's first two goals as they beat Racing Club 4–2 away from home. Falcao scored his first professional hat-trick on 28 September 2007, as River made a historic comeback against Botafogo to progress in the 2007 Sudamericana. The following week, he scored his first goal in a Superclásico, the first of River's goals as they beat Boca Juniors 2–0. River was reported to have rejected a $15 million offer from Milan for Falcao in early 2008, as well as bids from clubs including Aston Villa and Fluminense. He was a key player as Diego Simeone led River to the 2008 Torneo Clausura championship, his first domestic title, and his performances meant he was linked with moves to a variety of clubs. Nevertheless, he remained with River as they suffered the worst campaign in their history, finishing bottom of the 2008 Torneo Apertura. In 2009, River Plate had a difficult start: they were eliminated in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores 2009 and won few games at the beginning of the 2009 Torneo Clausura. Radamel retained his eye for goal, and was instrumental in Nestor Gorosito's plans, having matured as a striker over the previous two years, scoring more than 30 goals in domestic competition and more than 10 in CONMEBOL tournaments. Porto. 2009–10 season. Falcao moved to Europe when he joined the Portuguese giants FC Porto on 15 July 2009 for a fee of €3.93 million for 60% economic rights after Porto sold striker Lisandro López to Olympique Lyonnais. In the transaction, Porto also sold Mario Bolatti for €1.5 million to a third party owner, Natland Financier B.V., in exchange for 35% economic rights of Falcao. Curiously, Falcao was about to sign for Porto rivals Benfica days before, but the reluctance of its leaders to pay an additional €700,000 requested by Falcao dictated the end of negotiations; days later, Falcao joined Porto. He made his debut against Paços de Ferreira on the opening day of the season and scored an important goal to earn the team a draw. He went on to score three goals in as many games, making him one of the very few to score four goals in the first four matchdays in the Portuguese league. On 15 September, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in a 1–0 away defeat against Chelsea. Falcao would later score a brilliant header to defeat rivals Sporting Clube de Portugal on the sixth matchday, giving his team a 1–0 home victory. Four days later, on 30 September, he scored his first Champions League goal in a group stage win over Atlético Madrid. On 2 February 2010, Falcao scored twice in a Portuguese Cup quarter-finals victory against rivals Sporting CP. In the same month, he scored the victory goal against Arsenal in a UEFA Champions League round of 16 match, being his fourth goal in the tournament. On 3 April, Falcao scored a brace against Marítimo, and turned into the highest goalscorer of the Portuguese League with 20 goals, but he would finish the season as the second-highest league scorer with 25 goals, behind only Benfica's Óscar Cardozo, who had 26. He scored another goal in his last game of the season, the Portuguese Cup final, where Porto won 2–1 against Grupo Desportivo Chaves. He wrapped up the campaign with a career-high 34 goals in all competitions. 2010–11 season. Falcao made an impressive start to the 2010–11 season, scoring a goal in the 2010 Portuguese SuperCup 2–0 victory over Benfica. He scored his first two league goals on the second matchday of the season against Beira-Mar on 22 August 2010. On 7 November, he scored twice (one of them an impressive backheel goal) in a 5–0 victory against the defending champions Benfica, and later, on 2 December, Falcao scored his first hat-trick for Porto against Rapid Wien during a UEFA Europa League clash, becoming the top goal scorer of the competition with 17 goals. On 7 April 2011, Falcao scored another hat-trick in the quarter-final of the Europa League against Russian side Spartak Moscow, which was won by the Portuguese team by a score of 5–1, to bring his goal tally in the tournament to 10. In the 2010–11 season, Porto won the league title in round 25 of the league against rivals and defending champions Benfica at the Estádio da Luz. He played a key role in that match, winning his team a penalty when the match was tied at 1–1; the penalty was scored by teammate Hulk. In the match against Spartak Moscow in the Europa League, Falcao scored a hat-trick and provided an assist in a 5–1 win. In the second leg, he scored another goal and provided another assist that took Porto to the tournament's semi-final stage. He further added to his position as top scorer in the competition by scoring four goals in the semi-final first leg against Villarreal CF, a game which finished 5–1 in favour of Porto. In the UEFA Europa League final against domestic rivals Braga, Falcao scored the only goal of the game with a header after a cross from Fredy Guarín, giving the title to Porto. He set a new goalscoring record of 17 goals in 14 games during the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League, surpassing Jürgen Klinsmann's previous record of 15 goals. In July 2011, he extended his contract with an added €45 million buy-out clause. Porto paid a commission of €6,585,150 to extend the contract. Atlético Madrid. 2011–12 season. On 18 August 2011, Porto announced they are had agreed a fee with Atlético Madrid for the transfer of Falcao. The transfer fee was €40 million with the fee potentially rising by €10 million based on performance-based clauses, making him the most expensive player in the club's history. Falcao made his Atlético debut on 10 September away to Valencia CF, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 defeat. On 3 November, Falcao netted a goal in Atlético's 4–0 triumph over Udinese — the goal meant that Falcao had scored 19 goals in his last 18 Europa League games. Falcao's second hat-trick in La Liga came on 21 January 2012, when he led his team to a 4–0 victory against Real Sociedad at the Anoeta Stadium. On 16 February, Falcao scored twice and assisted a goal in an away game against Lazio to progress to the Round of 16 in the Europa League.

On 21 March, Falcao netted a second half double to propel his side to a 2–1 victory over Athletic Bilbao and keep Atletico in the race for European places. Falcao scored another goal sealing a 3–0 victory over Getafe CF. In both legs of the Europa League quarter-final tie versus Hannover 96, Falcao managed to score a goal for each leg, helping Atlético seal a 4–2 aggregate victory and increasing his goal tally to eight in the competition. Falcao played his first Madrid Derby against Real Madrid on 11 April 2012. He had missed the first match at the Santiago Bernabéu due to injury, and scored Atletico's only goal as his side fell 4–1 thanks to a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick. He scored his 22nd goal of the season against Rayo Vallecano in a crucial 1–0 victory for Atlético Madrid. For the first leg of the 2011–12 Europa league semifinals against Valencia CF, Falcao scored a double in a 4–2 victory while making Atlético the first team to win 10-straight matches in a single Europa League season. Falcao added to his Europa League tally in the final against fellow La Liga side Athletic Bilbao, netting Atlético's opening two goals in a 3–0 triumph at the Arena Na?ional? in Bucharest on 9 May 2012. In doing so, Falcao not only became the top goal scorer in a Europa league season again but became the first player in history to win two consecutive Europa League titles with two different teams. In all competitions, Falcao had scored a record of 36 goals for Atlético Madrid, the highest amount by any player in a first season playing for the club. 2012–13 season. Falcao scored two hat-tricks at the start of the 2012–13 season; first in the La Liga game against 2012 Europa League finalists Athletic Bilbao, and the second in the defeat of Chelsea, winning the 2012 UEFA Super Cup by a score of 4–1, on 31 August 2012. At the same time, Falcao became the first player in history to score a hat trick in a UEFA Super Cup final in its current format; the original format was two legged before turning into a single legged final format in 1998. On 16 September, Falcao scored what turned out to be the decisive goal from the penalty spot in a 4–3 win over Rayo Vallecano, and did the same a week later against Real Valladolid, before going off at half-time in order to avoid a possible groin injury. Falcao scored a double in a 4–2 away victory over Real Betis, converting a cross for the first and then converting a penalty, putting him to the top of the goal scoring charts in La Liga with seven goals. Falcao scored a wonderful header against Málaga CF and forced Málaga defender Weligton to score an own goal, pushing Atlético to victory in the final minute. He scored once again in the away fixture to Real Sociedad after the international break, this time with a rare free-kick — his first professional free kick-goal — in the 90th minute, winning the match 1–0. In a game against Sevilla FC, Falcao scored a penalty and assisted another goal in a 4–0 victory; the strike marked his 50th goal for Atletico Madrid. In the match against Deportivo de La Coruña on 9 December, Falcao scored an astonishing five goals, becoming the first player in La Liga in over a decade to net five goals in a game. For his last goal of the 2012 calendar year, Falcao scored the opening goal against Spanish giants FC Barcelona in a 4–1 loss at the Camp Nou. Falcao missed the first La Liga match of 2013 due to an injury but returned in the second match against Real Zaragoza, where he scored a penalty. It was noted that Falcao struggled to maintain form during the match. In the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-finals against Real Betis, Falcao scored a header in a 2–0 victory. Falcao returned on 3 February after being injured for three weeks where he failed to make a comeback on his return against Real Betis in a 1–0 victory. In a 2–1 loss against Rayo Vallecano, Falcao scored in the 94th minute on the day of his birthday. Falcao finally played his first match of the 2012–13 Europa League in a 2–0 lost against Rubin Kazan. Falcao scored against Real Valladolid in a 3–0 victory. In the second leg against Kazan of the Europa league, Falcao scored a late goal but it was not enough to save Atletico from being knocked out on a 2–1 aggregate. Falcao scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Espanyol, Altetico was down to 10 men at this time. In the Copa de Rey Semi-finals, Falcao scored against Sevilla FC in a 2–2 draw. Although Atletico advanced to the finals on a 4–3 aggregate as well as scoring twice before Sevilla. In the league match against Valencia CF, Valencia had scored a goal in the 4th minute stunning the home fans. However, Falcao responded with a goal of his own less than a minute later. The game however only ended 1–1. Falcao scored a double against Granada CF in a comfortable 5–0 victory. The second goal marked Falcao's 200th career goal (counting both club and nation). In an away match against Sevilla, Falcao scored the only goal in a 0–1 victory. In the Madrid Derby against Real Madrid, Falcao scored Atletico's only goal once more in a 1–2 home lost. Falcao scored the last goal for Atletico in a 3–1 away victory over Celta de Vigo. The win also assured Atletico Madrid to appear in the UEFA Champions League for next season for the first time in four years. In Falcao's last match against FC Barcelona for the 2012–13 season, Falcao scored yet another goal in another 2–1 home lost. This made Falcao one of the few players to consecutive score against them in three out of four La Liga appearances between the current and last season. 2013 Copa del Rey final. In the 2013 Copa del Rey Final, Atletico Madrid were given one final chance of the season to beat their arch-rivals Real Madrid for the first time in 14 years. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the game with a header in the 14th minute. In the 35th minute, Falcao had a chance to run forward while surrounded by Real players but did something different: after catching the ball, he pulled it backwards where two Real Madrid players bumpped into one another, leaving just 3 surrounding him. He cut to the right side and delivered a wonderful pass to Diego Costa who shot low equalizing moments later. In extra time, Miranda scored the winning goal with a header from a corner in the 98th minute. Despite Falcao not scoring a single goal, he took the home team by surprise in committing to the role of playmaker rather than a striker role. Thus, he abandoned the typical 'pure striker' role. This allowed Atletico to win the cup and defeat their arch rivals for the first time in 14 years. This is also Falcao's first domestic title with Atletico. AS Monaco. On 20 May 2013, Atlético Madrid general manager Miguel Ángel Gil Marín announced that the club will not stand in the way if Falcao decides to leave in the upcoming summer transfer window. On 31 May 2013, AS Monaco FC announced that they had reached an agreement with Atlético Madrid for a transfer. Falcao signed a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around €60 million, with his net annual salary at AS Monaco being reported to be around €14 million. Despite the Colombian showing optimism about his Monaco future, Falcao gave an emotional farewell to Atlético during a press interview, expressing his enjoyment with the club and considering it to be ""the best time of his career"". On an interesting note, Falcao went on to say that part of his reason for choosing Monaco was to follow the footsteps of his idol, Thierry Henry. Monaco sporting director Vadim Vasilyev said the acquisition of Falcao, one of the game’s top strikers was a real coup for the club. 2013–14.

Falcao managed to equalize with a diving header in a tough away match against french-giants and current league champions Paris Saint-Germain. The game would later end 1-1 and keep Monaco on top of the league table. Days later, Falcao scored a double against Bastia in a 3-0 victory. This also brings his goal tally to 7 and making him top goal scorer in the Ligue 1. International career. Early years 2005–2010. Falcao's national career was ""late"" in terms of chances in playing for the national team due to injuries around important events. He represented the under-17 national team and the under-20. Falcao was part of the team that won the 2005 edition of the South American Youth Champion. Eventually, his first major international tournament was of the 2005 U-20 World Cup. In the senior national team, Falcao's first goal came against Montenegro during the Kirin Cup held in Japan during 2007 at only 21 years of age, winning the match for Colombia 1–0. His second occurred later that year in a friendly against Peru. Falcao didn't score his third goal till 2008 against Nigeria in a 1–0 win. Falcao's first World Cup qualifying goal occurred in 2009, against Peru. His last goal for 2009 was against Venezuela in a friendly that ended 2–1. Falcao didn't score another goal for Colombia until the following year in 2011 during a friendly against Ecuador, where his prime talents began to emerge during this era. Falcao scored against Ecuador again a few months later in another friendly where he scored the winning goal on both occasions. 2011 Copa América. Falcao's first Copa América — he missed the 2007 edition due to injuries — was upon him. Falcao became a huge threatening factor as his reputation in Europe at this time made him a feared striker. Failing to score against Costa Rica and the host nation Argentina, Falcao stepped up scoring a double against Bolivia, causing Colombia to top their group, shocking and surprising the host country Argentina, who were favorites to win the group. In the next round, Falcao made a mistake when taking a penalty kick against Peru. Shooting wide, Falcao dashed Colombia's hopes of reaching the semi-finals, as Peru were able to score two goals in extra time due to various mistakes made by the Colombians. Falcao then vowed to perfect his penalty kick technique after missing his chance to send his team into the next round. 2014 World Cup Qualifiers. Falcao's first match in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers started off with a goal against Bolivia in the last minute of added time, giving Colombia the win. Under new management of the national team led by Argentine José Pekerman, Falcao scored a goal against Mexico in a friendly that ended 2–0. Falcao's talents were shown once more against the 2011 Copa América winners Uruguay, scoring in the second minute to help Colombia win 4–0 in a crucial qualifying win. In the same match, he assisted fellow countryman Juan Zúñiga, sealing the 4–0 victory in the final minutes of extra time. Falcao scored again days later as well as providing an assist against Chile to help give Colombia a 3–1 away win which put them second in the table, one point behind Argentina. Falcao contributed greatly by scoring both goals in a 2-0 victory over Paraguay. In Falcao's first game for 2013, he played in the qualifying match against Bolivia. Falcao scored with a header in the first 10 minutes. However, it was not counted since the assistant referee called the assist play pior to his goal as 'offside'. Although the replay showed that he was not offside and thus Falcao was wrongly disallowed. Regardless, Falcao scored in the final minutes of the game scoring the fourth goal. Falcao scored a penalty against Peru in the 13th minute where Colombia dominated the game entirely and won 2-0. Falcao was originally to take part in a friendly against Serbia, but requested to be excused for the birth of his first child: a daughter. Playing style and praise. Falcao has been described as one of the most ""natural in form, goal scorers"" in the world today. His abilities to adapt to most positions and scoring goals with various parts of his body has resulted in goals than most would never expect. His footing and curves are highly noticeable through his games regardless of distance and/or positions. Falcao is well known for having a strong weak foot (left) that is on equals with his right foot (preference) allowing him to be flexible with goal scoring even in the most awkward positions. Falcao controls a well balance pace keeping his stamina in check and allowing him to often out run other players in the most critical moments in obtaining the ball. The strength of his shots is often well controlled, in terms of distance and angles, as shown throughout his career. Uniquely, while Falcao is only of average height (just three inches taller than Lionel Messi), his header technique has given him an edge, winning generally all aerial battles for the balls. His most impressive goals tend to be headers, with the majority of his goals coming in the air. Falcao is said to play at his fullest capabilities only when he's under pressure and/or playing against a very strong team. Falcao's talents have been recognized by many football players former and current, perhaps most notably by former FC Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who described him as ""sensational"" and as one of the most talented in the world. Many figures such as Fabio Capello have considered him to be on the same level as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, while acknowledging Falcao as the best striker in the world. Some tout him as the best signing for the Spanish league in the 21st Century. Falcao has even been praised by current King of Spain Juan Carlos I himself for his remarkable talents. Personal life. Falcao is a second generation footballer, with his father Radamel García having played professionally as a defender in Colombia. His name derives from the 1980s Brazil, Internacional and Roma legend Falcão. Despite being named Radamel, he prefers to use his middle name in interviews. Falcao signed a long term deal with German brand Puma. He is a devout Christian and leader of various religious youth groups, including """"Locos por Jesús"""" and """"Campeones para Cristo."""" Falcao is married to Argentinean singer Lorelei Taron. In early 2013, it was revealed that Falcao is soon to be expecting his first child with her. Dominique García Taron was born on 13 August 2013, at Princess Grace Hospital in La Colle, Monaco. Falcao is good friends with Brazilian international star Kaká. Falcao is also noticeably on good terms with Cristiano Ronaldo, despite both being the star players of their own respective clubs (during Falcao's time with Atlético), whom are fierce rivals. Falcao is also friends with Lionel Messi, as the two have been seen often shaking hands and chatting together. They've also taken part in a charity match together. Following his move to join AS Monaco, Falcao expressed his admiration for Thierry Henry and wanting to follow in his footsteps after stating, 'My heart is in Monaco, since my idol Thierry Henry played for that team.'. Age concern. In July 2013, it came to light that Falcao's former primary school, Colegio San Pedro Claver de Bucaramanga, held a school card that indicated he was born in 1984. Days later however, Falcao and the media denied such claims and showcased his birth certificate to prove that he was in fact, born in 1986. Career statistics.

Zlatan Ibrahimovi?," Zlatan Ibrahimovi?  Zlatan Ibrahimovi? (, ; born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Swedish national team for which he is captain. Ibrahimovi? started his career at Malmö FF in the late 1990s under Roland Andersson. He was signed by Ajax, and made a name for himself under Ronald Koeman. He later signed with Juventus for €16 million. Ibrahimovi? gained fame in Serie A, benefiting from his strike partnership with David Trezeguet. In 2006, he signed with league rival Internazionale, where he won individual awards such as the Italian Oscar del Calcio and the Swedish Guldbollen, and was named in the 2007 and 2009 UEFA Team of the Year, in addition to finishing as the league's highest scorer in 2008–09 while winning three straight ""Scudetti"". In the summer of 2009, he transferred to Barcelona. His time at Barcelona was short-lived, however, moving back to Serie A football with Milan the following season, in a deal which made him one of the highest paid footballers in the world and cost the Italian club €24 million. He signed a three-year contract with Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012. He is regarded to be one of the most talented footballers of his generation. In 2012, he was ranked 5th in ""The Guardian""'s ""100 Best Footballers"" in the world. Early life. Ibrahimovi? was born in Sweden to a Bosnian Muslim father, Šefik Ibrahimovi?, who emigrated to Sweden in 1977, and a Croatian Catholic mother, Jurka Gravi?, who also emigrated to Sweden, where they first met. His father was born in Bijeljina, SFR Yugoslavia, and his mother was born in Prkos, Zadar County, SFR Yugoslavia. Ibrahimovi? grew up in Rosengård, a Malmö neighbourhood known for its immigrant communities, along with his three sisters and two brothers. After receiving a pair of football boots, Ibrahimovi? began playing football at the age of six, alternating between local junior clubs Malmö BI and FBK Balkan. He has stated in an interview that once when his team were 4–0 down at half-time, he came on as a substitute for his Balkan youth team and dramatically scored eight goals. While in his early teens, he was a regular for his hometown club Malmö FF. At the age of 15, Ibrahimovi? was close to quitting his football career, in favour of working at the docks in Malmö, but his manager convinced him to continue playing. Ibrahimovi? successfully completed junior high school in the ninth grade. Though he was admitted to Borgarskolan and had above-average grades, he soon dropped out of high school to focus on his football career. Club career. Malmö FF. Ibrahimovi? signed his first contract with Malmö in 1996, and moved up to the senior side for the 1999 season of Allsvenskan, Sweden's top-flight league. That season, Malmö finished 13th in the league and were relegated to the second division, but returned to the top flight the next season. Arsène Wenger unsuccessfully tried to persuade Ibrahimovi? to join Arsenal, while Leo Beenhakker also expressed interest in the player after watching him in a training match against Norwegian side Moss FK. On 22 March 2001, a deal between Ajax and Malmö regarding Ibrahimovi?'s transfer to Amsterdam was announced, and in July, Ibrahimovi? officially joined Ajax for 80 million Swedish kronor. Ajax. Ibrahimovi? received little playing time under manager Co Adriaanse, but when Adriaanse was sacked on 29 November 2001, new coach Ronald Koeman inserted Ibrahimovi? into the starting lineup as Ajax won the 2001–02 Eredivisie title. The next season, Ibrahimovi? scored twice in a 2–1 victory over French champions Lyon in his Champions League debut on 17 September 2002. He scored four Champions League goals overall as Ajax fell to Milan in the quarter-finals. In his final season with Ajax, Ibrahimovi?'s profile rose when he scored a breathtaking goal against NAC on 22 August 2004, a goal that was eventually voted the ""Goal of the Year"" by Eurosport viewers. He netted only once in the 2003–04 Champions League (against Celta Vigo on 22 October) as Ajax were eliminated in the group stage. On 18 August 2004, Ibrahimovi? injured fellow Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart during an international match against the Netherlands, which led to accusations from van der Vaart that Ibrahimovi? had hurt him intentionally. This led to Ibrahimovi?'s sudden sale to Juventus on 31 August. In May 2012, van der Vaart reignited the bitter feud between both players when he was filmed practicing his golf swing on a picture of Ibrahimovi?'s face. Juventus. Ibrahimovi? moved from Ajax to Juventus for €16 million. He was promptly inserted into the starting eleven due in part to top scorer David Trezeguet's injury problems, and scored sixteen goals. Near the end of the season, Juventus reportedly rejected a €70 million bid for him from Real Madrid, which was later revealed to be a publicity stunt initiated by Ibrahimovi?'s agent, Mino Raiola, in order to increase his market value. On 14 November 2005, he was awarded the ""Guldbollen"", a prize awarded to the best Swedish footballer of the year. The following season was poor compared to his first season; his role in Juventus' attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more to the sidelines, taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his assist numbers increased. In the 2005–06 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two ""Scudetti"" as part of the verdict from the ""Calciopoli scandal"", and were relegated to Serie B. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimovi? and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimovi? from his contract. Internazionale. On 10 August 2006, Ibrahimovi? completed a €24.8 million move to Internazionale, signing a four-year-deal, this coming only a few days after 30-year-old defensive midfielder Patrick Vieira had completed his own transfer from Juve to ""nerazzurri"". Ibrahimovi? revealed that he had supported Inter when he was young. Playing under head coach Roberto Mancini, Ibrahimovi? started his spell at the club by scoring one goal and assisting another in a league match against Fiorentina and ended his first season as Inter's top goalscorer with 15 goals. Inter won the league for the first time in 17 years. They finished the Serie A season with 97 points, a league record, a feat Ibrahimovi? would go on to repeat at FC Barcelona. During the season Inter also broke the European Big Five League Record for most consecutive wins, 17. The record still stands. Ibrahimovi? played his 100th Serie A match on 16 September 2007. His contract was renewed in 2007, it was due to expire in June 2013. He was estimated as the top of footballer wages. He scored two Champions League goals in the group stage against PSV on 2 October, which marked his first European goals since December 2005 and his first goals overall in an Inter jersey, and finished with five goals in seven Champions League matches. Against Parma in the final league matchday on 18 May 2008, he returned from a chronic knee injury and scored both goals as Inter won 2–0, clinching their third straight ""Scudetto"". On 16 November 2008, Ibrahimovi? said that he would not return to the Allsvenskan as an active player, but he would stay the rest of his active career as a player abroad. Ibrahimovi?'s 2008–09 season started brilliantly, hitting the back of the net in Inter's first league match. His goal against Bologna was voted ""Goal of the Year"". He scored it with his heel without moving and accurately into the net from a cross by Adriano. Ibrahimovi?'s form in the season had been eye-catching, with clever movement on and off the ball, and his passing had been outstanding, such as his acrobatic pass against Lazio. He ended a month long goal drought against Genoa, handing them their first home loss of the season, making Inter the only team not to lose at home in the league. In the final league game of the season, Ibrahimovi? scored twice against Atalanta, securing the ""Capocannoniere"" for himself by finishing one goal ahead of Marco Di Vaio and Diego Milito with 25 goals in the domestic season. Barcelona. After Maxwell completed his transfer to Barcelona, president Joan Laporta confirmed that there was an agreement in principle between Barcelona and Internazionale for Ibrahimovi? to join the club in exchange for Samuel Eto'o, plus a fee. Laporta revealed that the negotiations started when he decided to divert a flight, which was originally from Ukraine to Spain, in order to have talks with Massimo Moratti, the president of Internazionale, in Milan. Ibrahimovi? left Internazionale during their United States summer tour in the World Football Challenge on 23 July 2009 for negotiations with Barcelona, with his last match for Internazionale being against Chelsea. After Internazionale agreed terms with Eto'o and Barcelona with Ibrahimovi?, Barcelona announced Ibrahimovi? would arrive on 26 July 2009 and undergo a medical test on 27 July 2009. Ibrahimovi? passed his medical and was presented to a crowd of over 60,000 at Camp Nou. He signed a 5-year contract, for €46 million and the exchange of Eto'o (valued at €20 million) and loan of Alexander Hleb (with an option to buy for a €10 million fee), with a €250 million release clause, making Ibrahimovi? worth €66 million. However, the Hleb deal collapsed. Eventually Ibrahimovi? cost Barcelona €69.884 million which including other fees. Inter book the fee was €69.5 million, but part of the Inter fee (about 4.5%) was redistributed to youth clubs as solidarity contribution (except Juventus.) Ibrahimovi? started the 2009–10 season with his competitive debut for Barcelona on 23 August 2009 by assisting on a goal by Lionel Messi, leading them to the Spanish Super Cup. In his next competitive match, Barcelona won the 2009 UEFA Super Cup. In his third appearance, he scored his first goal in Barcelona's La Liga season opener against Sporting Gijón in a 3–0 win. Ibrahimovi? went on to score in his next three appearances, thus setting a team record as the only player ever to score in his first four league matches. On 20 October, he scored his first Champions League goal for Barcelona in a group stage match against Rubin Kazan. Five days later, he scored twice in a 6–1 thrashing of Real Zaragoza, giving him a league-leading seven goals in seven league matches while bringing Barcelona to the top of the table. However, on 7 November, Ibrahimovi? suffered a thigh injury that kept him out for three weeks. He returned to action in week 12 of the season against Real Madrid as a second-half substitute for Thierry Henry, and scored his eighth goal of the campaign. He finished with eleven goals and four assists in all but two of Barcelona's first fifteen league matches. Barcelona capped off 2009 by winning the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes on 19 December 2009. Ibrahimovi? scored Barcelona's only goal in the 2009–10 Copa del Rey first leg match of the round of sixteen in a 2–1 loss to Sevilla on 5 January 2010. On 20 January, he was selected in the 2009 UEFA Team of the Year. His first goal of 2010 came on 14 February against Atlético Madrid. In his next appearance, Ibrahimovi? scored against Stuttgart in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League knockout stage fixture. He was sent off on 6 March in a league match against Almería, which Barcelona appealed to no avail, and he was suspended for one game. A calf strain during warmups before the next La Liga match following his return from suspension against Athletic Bilbao ruled Ibrahimovi? out of the second leg 4–1 victory over Arsenal, in which he scored two goals away from home, the return leg of the El Clásico against Madrid (which Barcelona won 2–0), and the next league match against Deportivo La Coruña. He made his return as a substitute in the 82nd minute in against Espanyol. Ibrahimovi? finished the season with a sixth-best 16 league goals, as Barcelona won La Liga with 99 points in 38 matches. He scored his final goal for Barcelona in a Spanish Super Cup match on 14 August in a 3–1 defeat over Sevilla, and on 25 August, he played his last match for the club against Milan for the Joan Gamper Trophy, after which he claimed to the media that his relationship with coach Pep Guardiola had started deteriorating and that Guardiola had not spoken to him since March. Milan. On 28 August 2010, Milan announced on their official website that they had acquired the services of Ibrahimovi? for the 2010–11 season. He was loaned out to Milan for the 2010–11 season, with Milan having the option to purchase him outright from Barcelona for €24 million at the end of the season. He made his team debut in a 2–0 loss to Cesena on 11 September, in which he missed a penalty late in the match, and scored his first goals for the club when Milan defeated Auxerre in their first Champions League match of the season on 15 September. On 14 November, Ibrahimovi? scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory against his former club Internazionale in the Milan Derby. On 20 November, he scored his seventh goal against Fiorentina in the 45th minute with an over-the-head bicycle kick, passing Alexandre Pato as the team's top goal scorer for the season. On 4 December 2010, in a game against Brescia, he assisted Kevin Prince-Boateng to give Milan an early lead and then scored the third goal by a powerful shot near the edge of the penalty box to give Milan a 3–0 win. On 12 December 2010, history repeated himself in the game against Bologna after he assisted Boateng to give Milan an early lead once again and scoring later that match to make it 3–0, leading him to 13 goals with 8 assists in 21 matches in all competitions, after which he has been compared to Milan legend Marco van Basten by both the media and van Basten himself. Ibrahimovi? received a three-match ban, after getting a red card in a 1–1 home draw against Bari in March 2011 for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach. An additional three-match ban was given to Ibrahimovi? in February 2012, in a 1–2 home defeat against Fiorentina, for supposedly swearing at an assistant referee. Ibrahimovi? stated in his defense that he was talking to himself in frustration. He won his first ""Scudetto"" with Milan after a stalemate against Roma. He is therefore currently on a streak of eight straight league wins in three different countries and with five different clubs, including the later stripped wins with Juventus. All agreements between Milan and Barcelona were confirmed on 18 June 2011. In the first official match of the 2011–12 season, Ibrahimovi? opened it in the best possible way scoring the first goal of a Milan comeback to beat city rivals Internazionale in the Italian Super Cup. He also scored Milan's first goal of their 2011–12 Serie A season in a 2–2 draw against Lazio. He scored his third goal in the first three games in Milan's Champions League game against Czech club Viktoria Plze? from the penalty spot and assisted the second goal. Ibrahimovi? justified his tag of the carrier of Milan by scoring in many games, yet still providing many assists. He scored in the next UEFA Champions League game against BATE Borisov, a goal in Milan's 4–1 win over Parma and two more in their 2–3 win over Roma, ending a successful month of October. November was equally impressive for the Swede, scoring in consecutive games against BATE, in the Champions League, and Catania, in the league. In the highly anticipated encounter between Milan and Barcelona, Ibrahimovi? scored against his old club to equalise the game at 1–1 but eventually Barça ran away 3–2 winner at the San Siro. He ended November with a brace against Chievo, his first goal took his tally of goals in Serie A to 100 goals, and the second from the penalty spot. Ibrahimovi? continued his impressive form in December, and scored a goal in each of five Serie A games. 2012 started on high note for Ibrahimovi?, as he scored against Atalanta converting a penalty kick. He was the top goalscorer of Serie A, with 14 goals in 16 appearance, after the brace against Novara, of which second goal, came after cheeky backheel. On 5 January 2012 in a match against Napoli on continuation of Serie A, Ibra awarded a red card for slapping Salvatore Aronica in an off-the-ball incident and will rule out of Milan's next three games. On 15 February, in the 2011–12 Champions League season, Ibrahimovi? set up all two Robinho's goals and also scored by a spot kick, thus helping Milan win 4–0 over Arsenal. He continued his goalscoring run in March 2012, with a hat-trick in a 4–0 away win against Palermo at the Stadio Renzo Barbera. The first two goals were assisted by Robinho and the third by Emanuelson. In the next three games, he scored four goals, two against Roma, which took his tally to 22 goals in 23 games. With two goals against Siena, Ibrahimovi? surpassed his previous domestic goal record of 25 goals. He finished the season with 28 goals in 32 matches. Paris Saint-Germain. On 17 July 2012, Paris Saint-Germain confirmed that they had reached an agreement to acquire the sporting and economic rights of Ibrahimovi? from Milan, having already agreed personal terms with the striker, for an initial transfer fee of around €20 million, making Ibrahimovi? the most expensive footballer in combined transfer fees. Valued at €180 million, it eclipsed those commanded by Nicolas Anelka. His three-year contract would see him receive a net annual salary of €14 million including bonuses (which would be €2 million more than what he was earning per year just before he left Milan), and make him the second best paid footballer in the world behind Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o. The following day, Ibrahimovi? signed the contract and made the following statement during the press conference: ""It is a big step in my career and another dream come true. I am very happy because it is a project that I want to be involved in. I want to be part of the history of the club. I am here to win and nothing else."" Ibrahimovi? scored twice in the second half for PSG to help them rally from 2–0 down at half-time to salvage a 2–2 home draw with Lorient in their opening 2012–13 Ligue 1 match. He scored two goals in the first half to help PSG to a 2–1 win over Lille which was PSG's first Ligue 1 win after three successive draws in the first three league matches of the 2012–13 season. In the opening 2012–13 UEFA Champions League Group A match against Dynamo Kyiv on 18 September 2012, Ibrahimovi? scored his sixth goal in only his fifth appearance for Carlo Ancelotti's side through a penalty. He thus became the first man to score for six clubs in the UEFA Champions League. On 8 October 2012, Ibrahimovi? became only the third player (after Ronaldinho and Laurent Blanc) to have played in the El Clásico in Spain, the Milan derby in Italy and the Le Classique, the derby between Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain. He scored both of PSG's goals (the first goal was from a backheel and the second was from a free kick) in the Ligue 1 Le Classique derby at the Stade Vélodrome on that day, with the match finishing 2–2. On 11 December 2012, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 away win against Valenciennes. In January, Ibrahimovi? was handed the number 10 jersey after the departure of Brazilian winger Nené. In April 2013, Ibrahimovi? scored in a 2–2 draw against his former club Barcelona in the quarter finals of the Champions League. However, PSG were knocked out on away goals after drawing 1–1 at Camp Nou in the second leg. He ended the season as assists leader in the 2012–2013 Champions League, providing 7 assists. On 12 May 2013, Paris Saint-Germain won the Ligue 1 title after a 1–0 away win against Olympique Lyonnais, their third title and first since 1994. He ended the year as Ligue 1's top goalscorer with 30 goals, becoming the first player to reach that mark in the French top flight since Jean-Pierre Papin in the 1989–90 season. On 20 May 2013, he was named as Ligue 1's player of the year by the Union nationale des footballeurs professionnels (UNFP). On 24 September 2013, it was announced that Ibrahimovi? had extended his contract with Paris Saint-Germain, which now will expire in 2016. International career. Even though Ibrahimovi? was eligible to play for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, he chose to play for Sweden, his country of birth. Ibrahimovi? made his debut in a 0–0 friendly draw against the Faroe Islands at Tipshallen on 31 January 2001 during the 2000–01 Nordic Football Championship. On 7 October 2001, he made first competitive match in a 2002 World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan, scoring a goal in a 3–0 win. Ibrahimovi? was part of Sweden's 2002 FIFA World Cup finals squad who were eliminated in the round of 16 by newcomers Senegal. He made two substitute appearances, in the 88th minute of the final group game against Argentina and the 76th minute of the match against Senegal. Ibrahimovi? was in the starting lineup for all of Sweden's Euro 2004 matches. He scored a penalty in a 5–0 win against Bulgaria and rounded off a fine performance against Italy by scoring a late equaliser chip with his back heel, which was voted the goal of the tournament. However, he missed a penalty as Sweden were sent home following a shootout loss to the Netherlands. During 2006 World Cup qualification, Ibrahimovi? scored four goals in a 7–0 victory away to Malta on 4 September 2004. He did not score during the 2006 World Cup finals as Sweden were knocked out in the round of 16, this time by Germany. He was called up for a Euro 2008 qualifier against Liechtenstein on 6 September 2006, but two days before the match, he violated team curfew by leaving the hotel with teammates Christian Wilhelmsson and Olof Mellberg and visiting a nightclub. Though none of the players consumed any alcohol, they were nonetheless all sent home by manager Lars Lagerbäck as punishment and did not take part in the match. Mellberg and Wilhelmsson did not appeal the coach's decision, but Ibrahimovi? felt that it was unjust and therefore refused to take part in Sweden's next qualifiers against Iceland and Spain. He also refused to partake in a friendly against Egypt on 7 February 2007, but ended his self-imposed boycott a month later, and returned for Sweden's loss to Northern Ireland on 28 March. He did not score in any of the 12 qualifying matches. Ibrahimovi? was awarded the 2007 Swedish Golden Ball as the ""Country's Top Player of the Year."" Ibrahimovi? ended his international goal drought, which had lasted for over two years, against Greece in Sweden's Euro 2008 opener on 10 June 2008, and the next match against Spain four days later. He finished the tournament with two goals as Sweden were eliminated in the group stage by Russia. Ibrahimovi? scored a goal in a 4–0 win against Malta on 10 June 2009 in a 2010 World Cup qualifier. On 5 September 2009, he scored a last second goal in Stadium Puskás Ferenc against Hungary in a 2–1 win for Sweden in their qualification match. Ahead of the Euro 2012 qualifications, Ibrahimovi? was named team captain on his return to the national team. He scored his first goals of the qualifying game against San Marino where he scored the first and fifth goals in a 6–0 win in front of over 21,000 home fans despite being down to 10 men for over an hour. His next goals came in the form of a hat-trick against Finland whom they beat 5–0. At the Euro 2012 finals, Ibrahimovi? scored the opening goal in Sweden's first game against Ukraine. He then scored with a volley, later considered the goal of the tournament, to open the score in Sweden's 2–0 win against France in the last group match.

Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi reported that Ibrahimovi? threatened to publicly beat up Guardiola if he was not released to Milan. In March 2011, Ibrahimovi? was given a three-match ban for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach during a game. He received another three-match ban in February 2012 for slapping Napoli player Salvatore Aronica.

Colombia national football team," Colombia national football team  The Colombian National Football Team represents Colombia in international football competitions and is controlled by the Colombian Football Federation. It is a member of the CONMEBOL. It is currently ranked 5th in the FIFA World Rankings, and ranked 8th in Elo World Rankings. Colombia had its strongest period during the 1990s where they were among the giants in world football. A match during this period in 1993 resulted in a 5–0 win over Argentina which caused a special 'mutual respect' rivalry between both nations. The goalkeeper René Higuita achieved fame from his eccentric scorpion kick clearance against England at Wembley in 1995. At the 2001 Copa America, Óscar Córdoba became the first and only goal keeper in history to keep a perfect clean sheet in a Copa America. Other stars from this team included Carlos Valderrama and Faustino Asprilla. During this era Colombia qualified for the 1990, 1994, and 1998 editions of the World Cup, only reaching the second round in 1990. Colombia suffered over three World Cup cycles between 2002 to 2010, failing to be as strong as it had been in the 1990s; unable to qualify for the FIFA World Cup since 1998. Colombia has had problems throughout this era living up to the legacy of the older generations that rose the team's reputation. However, in recent times during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Colombia has played with a new talented golden generation, bringing its current rank to 5th place in the FIFA world rankings. Returning in the top 10 for the first time since 2002, nearly 10 years around the end of the previous golden era and into the top 5 in the end of 2012 for the first time since 2004. Since the mid-1980s, the Colombian National team has been a stronghold fighting the negative stereotypes towards the country's reputation. This has also made the sport very popular and made the national team a sign of nationalism, pride, and passion for many Colombians world wide. Thus, Colombia is known for having a very passionate fan base in both national and international games world wide. They were the champions of the 2001 Copa América, which they hosted and set a new record of being undefeated, conceding no goals and winning each match. Prior to that success they were runners-up to Peru in the 1975 Copa América. Interestingly, Colombia was the first team to win FIFA best mover in 1993 where the achievement was first introduced and the second team after Croatia to win it twice with the second being in 2012. The team are nicknamed ""Los Cafeteros"" due to the coffee production in their country. History. Colombia won the Central American Cup in 1946, a cup they would win again in 1970. They first entered World Cup qualifying in the 1958 qualifiers, but were unsuccessful. Colombia drew with Uruguay in Bogotá 1–1, but lost in Montevideo 1–0. Later, Colombia narrowly lost against Paraguay 3–2 in Bogotá and later in Asunción 3–0, leaving the team at the bottom of CONMEBOL Group Three with one point. 1962 FIFA World Cup. In the 1962 qualifiers, they faced Peru in a two-game series and qualified for their first World Cup. Colombia qualified. At Chile 1962, Colombia lost 2–1 to South American champions Uruguay in their opening match. They then drew 4–4 with the reigning European champions Soviet Union in one of biggest shocks at Chile 1962. It should be noted that in this game, Colombia scored four goals against Soviet goalkeepr Lev Yashin, widely considered the best goalkeeper in football history. Also in that game, Marcos Coll scored the only Olympic goal in World Cup history. Additionally, in coming back from three goals down to draw the match, the Colombians completed one of the biggest comeback to draw in World Cup history (a feat decades later shared with Uruguay since their 3-3 draw with Senegal in the 2002 World Cup). Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5–0 defeat to Euro 1960 runners-up Yugoslavia, so they went out in the group stage. Group One Aftermath and growth of ""La Selección"". Colombia entered the 1966 qualifiers and finished bottom of their group behind Chile and Ecuador. The 1970 qualifiers proved to be little better. Shortly before the 1970 World Cup Colombia played a friendly against England losing 4–0, in a game which was overshadowed by the Bogotá Bracelet incident. In the 1974 qualifiers, Colombia finished behind Uruguay only on goal difference. In the 1975 Copa América, Colombia finished runners-up, losing to Peru 2–0. For the 1990 World Cup, South America was allocated three-and-a-half berths at the 1990 finals. The continent's nine remaining sides were split into three groups with the two automatic qualifying berths going to the two best group winners, in this instance Uruguay and Brazil. The group winner with the worst record would advance to the CONMEBOL / OFC Intercontinental Play-off. Thus Colombia had to take on the winners of the Oceania zone. Curiously, this turned out to be Israel, after they finished ahead of Australia and New Zealand in the final qualifying group. Colombia qualified for their first FIFA World Cup since Chile 1962 after winning in Barranquilla 1–0, and tying in Israel 0–0. 1990 FIFA World Cup. At Italia '90, Colombia defeated United Arab Emirates 2–0, lost to Yugoslavia 1–0, and earned their place in the Round of Sixteen after a dramatic 1–1 draw with West Germany, which would later win the Cup. Group D During their Round of Sixteen match against Cameroon, the game went into extra time after a 0–0 draw. In an unfortunate moment, goalkeeper René Higuita failed to protect the ball from the goal line, enabling Cameroon striker Roger Milla to snatch it from him, and score Cameroon's decisive second goal. Milla struck twice, giving Cameroon a 2–0 lead in extra time. Colombia would score in the 115th minute, but were unable to get an equalizer. 1994 FIFA World Cup. Qualification — CONMEBOL Group One Colombia qualified. ""Argentina"" advanced to the CONMEBOL / CONCACAF / OFC Intercontinental Play-off. Colombia finished top of their qualifying group without having lost a match, which included a historic 5–0 win over Argentina in Buenos Aires. Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favourites to win the tournament. The match between Colombia and Romania was the first game for either side in the group phase. Romania took the lead in the 16th minute with their first attack of the match when Raducioiu took on three defenders before firing home a low shot. On the half hour mark, Hagi made it 2–0 when he noticed Córdoba out of position and dipped a cross over his head into the net. Valencia pulled a goal back for the Colombians in the 43rd minute when he headed in a corner from Perez. In the second half, Raducioiu put the result beyond doubt with his second goal in the final few minutes.  The team went into their second group game against the United States knowing they had to win to have any chance of progressing. On the 35th minute Andrés Escobar attempted to cut out a cross but accidentally deflected the ball into his own net. Earnie Stewart took the US two goals in front after scoring in the 56th minute. Valencia scored a consolation goal for Colombia in the closing minutes of the match. They did win their final group match 2–0 over Switzerland, but it was not enough to help them progress Group A 1998 FIFA World Cup. Colombia began their qualification rounds in South America well and ended in third place with 28 points, 2 points below Argentina who was in 1st place with 30 points. They ended in Group G with Tunisia, England, and Romania. Qualification For France 98: A total of 10 CONMEBOL teams entered the competition. The South American zone was allocated 5 places (out of 32) in the final tournament. Brazil, the defending champions, qualified automatically, leaving 4 spots open for competition between 9 teams. Final Standings Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Chile qualified. Group G In their opening match, Adrian Ilie of Valencia CF gave Romania a 1–0 victory over Colombia after he placed a magnificent chip shot in the 44th minute from some that sailed over goalkeeper Farid Mondragón into the net. Colombia's second match was against Tunisia. Colombia's Leider Preciado struck seven minutes from the end to give a 1-0 win. Although England needed only a draw to guarantee a place in the Final 16, Darren Anderton drove home a fiercely struck angled drive in the 20th minute. David Beckham curled in a free kick nine minutes later and England won the game 2-0. Colombia was thus eliminated. 2001 Copa América. Colombia's exit at France '98 marked the end of an era, as many expected, but one last moment of glory came at Copa América 2001. The Copa América in 2001 was held in Colombia, from 11 to 29 July. It was organised by CONMEBOL, South America's football governing body. Prior to the tournament, three meetings were held by CONMEBOL authorities who were concerned about potential security issues in Colombia, for what Venezuela offered to host the competition. At the last minute, CONMEBOL decided to return the organization to Colombia, and the tournament was held on schedule. Complaining for the sudden decision, and claiming that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups, the Argentine Football Association decided to withdraw from the competition. Because Canada and Argentina withdrew, on July 6 and July 10 respectively, Honduras and Costa Rica were invited. There were no terrorist incidents within the competition. Colombia was placed in Group A with Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador, and they finished on top of the group with nine points Group Stage: Quarter-Finals: Semi-Finals: Final: Hosts Colombia won their first Copa América title by beating Mexico in Bogotá. Their captain Iván Córdoba scored the decisive goal early in the second half with a header from a free kick. It was a fairytale success for Colombia after the decision to go ahead with the tournament after it had initially been cancelled. Even the fact that Argentina, regarded by most observers as the strongest side in the region, elected not to take part and that most countries fielded weakened teams failed to dampen the celebrations in Bogotá. It was also noted the following year that Brazil was then considered to be the strongest in the region at the time following their 2002 FIFA World Cup victory thus making the event 'legit'. This is also credited to the fact that Argentina failed to make it out of the group stage at the 2002 World Cup. 2002 FIFA World Cup. For Korea/Japan 2002, hopes were high for Colombia, but a weak attack and internal turmoil crushed their hopes. Colombia only managed to place sixth in the qualification round. Uruguay and Colombia had both 27 points but due to goal difference, Uruguay advanced to the play-offs with Australia. Final Standings 2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oro. The 2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oro, or Gold Cup, was played in July 2005 in the United States. Colombia and South Africa were invited guests.

Panama clipped Colombia 3–2 in front of more than 40,000 people at Giants Stadium. 2006 FIFA World Cup. 2006 FIFA World Cup -Germany was an important moment for Colombia, having failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Head coach Francisco Maturana led the team through 4 FIFA qualifiers and was fired after losing to Brazil 2–1 in Barranquilla, getting thrashed 4–0 by a weak Bolivia and suffering a shocking 1–0 defeat at home to Venezuela. Following a 1–1 tie with Argentina he was fired and Reinaldo Rueda was placed as the new coach. Colombia seemed to have improved and defeated Peru and Uruguay 5–0 during qualifying, managed a 3–0 victory over arch-rivals Ecuador, and tied with Brazil 0–0 in São Paulo. Towards the end Colombia (21 pts), Chile (21pts), and Uruguay (22 pts) had a chance to target the playoffs with Australia. Colombia (21 pts) traveled to Asunción hoping for three points against Paraguay (28), who sealed their place in Germany while Chile battled against Ecuador and Uruguay against Argentina. As in the 2002 qualifiers, the last match of Argentina was against Uruguay, and in both occasions Uruguay needed a favourable result to reach 5th place in order to make the playoffs to earn a place in the World Cup. Even though Colombia won its match against Paraguay, Uruguay also won the match against Argentina, again reaching the position to play the playoff for the last ticket to Germany. Both Argentina and Paraguay had already qualified. Colombia ended with 24 pts, once again behind Uruguay with 25 pts. Final Standings 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games. Group Stage Quarter Finals After Copa América 2007. After Copa América 2007, the Colombian national football team boomed with recent success in the South American 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. After embarrassing losses against Paraguay, and Argentina in the Copa América, many Colombians nonetheless anticipated a successful run for 2010 FIFA World Cup classification. In the first match of the qualifying round, Colombia, defying expectations that they would lose to Brazil, drew 0–0 with Brazil at home. Not long after that, Colombia surprisingly tied 0–0 again with Bolivia national football team, but many argue that this was largely due to the fact that the altitude of La Paz contributes to usual losses or ties for non-Bolivian teams. However, Colombia would find their very first win after defeating a weak Venezuela national football team 1–0, with a stupendous free kick courtesy of Rubén Darío Bustos. In their next game, Colombia would defy expectations again by beating Argentina, at the time ranked first in the world. On November 17, 2007, In Bogotá against Argentina, Lionel Messi beat the defense before scoring past goalkeeper Agustín Julio. Colombia turned the game around in the second half, however, when Rubén Darío Bustos got his second free kick goal of the qualifying campaign, and not long after that, Dayro Moreno scored his first international goal for Colombia.

Successive defeats to Uruguay and Paraguay at home, and a thrashing away to Chile, however, left Colombia in an extremely dangerous position knocking them out of the top five and forcing them to set their sights on the fifth play-off spot only. As of September 25, 2009, they are eighth after a 3–1 defeat at the hands of Uruguay in Montevideo. On October 10, 2009, Colombia lost 4–2 in Colombia against Chile, losing any possibility of assisting to 2010 World Cup.

They played an Exhibition Match against South Africa a month before the World Cup started, which they lost 2–1. The game was the first soccer match played in the recently built Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. All three goals of the match were scored by penalty kicks, and the match was highly criticized because both of the South Africa penalty kicks did not seem to be fouls at all, and because of the reported partiality of the referee towards the South Africa team. Another Exhibition Match was played in England against Nigeria, a match that ended in a 1–1 draw. Both matches were the first ones that coach Hernán Darío Gómez directed after his designation and return to Colombia's coaching. With a 2–0 win over Venezuela, and a 1–0 win against Ecuador, they wanted success over USA (which ended 0–0). In between all that they lost to Mexico 1–0.

They successfully defeated Ecuador again 2–0 but suffered a 2–0 defeat to Chile in March even after many goal attempts. Colombia had beaten Hounduras 2-0 after two spectacular goals from Teo, although many fans complain games such as this one aren't testing their full potential. In Ft. Lauderdale, Colombia beat Jamaica 2-0 with Jackson Martinez and Teo scoring to test Leonel Álvarez's side as a coach. 2011 Copa América. Group A. In Copa América 2011, Colombia showed great skill beating Costa Rica 1-0 goal given by Adrian Ramos thanks to an assist by Fredy Guarin. Colombia with an epic match against Argentina dominating the game almost entirely although suffered by their weakness in goal scoring thus ending 0-0. Finally, they crushed Bolivia 2-0 both goals by Radamel Falcao one by penalty. This resulted in shocking the host nation Argentina, who were favorites to win the group. After that they confronted Peru with high expectations. Before extra time, Falcao was given a penalty only to miss by a wide shot and forcing into extra time. Colombia lost 2-0 after a mistake by defense as Mario Yepes had accidentally tripped goal keeper Neco Martínez who conceded no goals up to this point allowing Peruvian player Carlos Lobatón a clear shot. Martinez later had mistakenly kicked the ball to Juan Manuel Vargas who sealed the victory for Peru. 1st Half of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Cycle Qualification Standings.

Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais per month and at 16, 125,000 reais per month. At 17, he signed a full professional contract, getting upgraded to the Santos first team and even receiving sponsorships. Club career. Santos. Youth. Neymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos FC, who offered him a contract in 2003, where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Bruno Coutinho Martins, Clodoaldo, Diego Walsh, Elano and Alex. He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at ""Peixe"" (the football club's nickname). While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Neymar is a great player that liked to play soccer when he was a young boy. He has one sister that did not play soccer. At the age 14, he travelled to Spain in order to join Real Madrid, at the time when Real had stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Robinho. Neymar passed the trial for his potential move, but Santos reportedly paid 1 million reals to Neymar to keep him at the club. Neymar progressed through the youth ranks rapidly and he was finally awarded a promotion to the Santos first team in 2009. 2009 season. Neymar made his professional debut on 7 March 2009, despite being only 17 years old; he was brought on for the last thirty minutes, in a 2–1 win against Oeste. The following week he scored his first goal for Santos against Mogi Mirim. One month later, on 11 April, Neymar scored the decisive goal in a 2–1 win against Palmeiras in the 2009 Campeonato Paulista semi-final first leg. In the final, however, Santos suffered a 4–2 aggregate defeat to the Corinthians. In his first season, Neymar racked up 14 goals in 48 games. 2010 season.

Following the 2010 Campeonato Paulista in which Neymar scored 14 goals in 19 games, the club were crowned champions after a 5–5 aggregate win over Santo André in the finals.

In 2010, Santos rejected a £12 million bid for him from English Premier League team West Ham United, and later an offer from another English club Chelsea, reported to be in the region of £20 million. Despite Santos unwillingness to sell and Neymar himself insisting ""I'm focused only on Santos"", his agent, Wagner Ribeiro, indicated that Neymar’s career was elsewhere, stating ""He wants to become the best player in the world. The chances of him doing that while playing in Brazil are zero."" Although one year later Neymar admitted, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, that he had been happy with Chelsea's interest in him as it was a ""dream"" of his ""to play in Europe"", whilst also stating that at the time it had been the right decision to stay in Brazil.

The previous year, his family had sold a 40% stake in Neymar's sporting rights to the DIS Esporte group who had been a long-term strategic partner of Santos' football club. Despite his first two seasons being highly successful, having ended the 2010 season with an impressive 42 goals in 60 games, problems had been identified, namely Neymar's apparent taste for diving when tackled, rather than attempting to continue his run, and his attitude. The latter came to the forefront during a match with Goianiense, on 15 September 2010, when the Santos' manager, Dorival Júnior, appointed another player to take the penalty awarded for a foul on Neymar. His decision was based on the fact that Neymar had missed a crucial penalty during the Copa do Brasil final of that year, even if Santos went on to win. Reacting to this, Neymar turned his back on his manager, had to be calmed down by a linesman and argued with his captain, Edu Dracena. The fallout from this event was that Dorival Junior wished to have Neymar suspended for two weeks, but the board sided with the player and promptly sacked the manager. Despite Neymar's apologies over the incident, some doubts still remain about his attitude.

In the next two or three seasons he will become the best player.""

[...] A lot of times he will fall because he can't do anything else, but he was overdoing it."" He continued: ""Even when he is fouled, he can't make a spectacle out of it"". Neymar's increasing reputation led both the media and former great players to draw comparisons between Neymar and FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, which Neymar has commented on saying: ""Messi is above everyone, there is no use comparing me with him. [...] He is the best player in the world and I always get inspired when I watch good football."" Ronaldo said: “Neymar is a great talent, the best we have in Brazil. He is very similar to Messi.” Zico said: “I see Neymar like a Ronaldo or a Messi, the type who appears and makes things happen.” After his hat-trick against Internacional 3–1 in Copa Libertadores and Messi's five goals scored in the Champions League, Neymar said: ""I am a Messi fan.

He left the club after seven years to join professional outfit Lille, but departed the club after three years after having difficulties adjusting. In 1999, Ribéry joined US Boulogne, where he played for two years. After spending two more years in the amateur divisions with two different clubs (Alès and Brest), in 2004, Ribéry earned a move to Ligue 1 club FC Metz.

Ribéry was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Pas-de-Calais and raised in a low-income neighbourhood on the fringes of the city. When he was two years old, he and his family were involved in a car accident in his hometown, colliding with a truck. Ribéry suffered serious facial injuries that resulted in more than one hundred stitches and which left two long scars down the right side of his face. Prior to joining Stade Brestois in 2003, he worked as a construction worker with his father, which Ribéry referred to as a ""learning experience"".  Ribéry's younger brother François is also a football player, and has played for numerous amateur clubs in France. François played for Bayonne in the Championnat National. Ribéry's wife, Wahiba, is a French national of Algerian descent and the couple have two daughters and a son. Ribéry is a convert to Islam and, following his conversion, adopted the name Bilal Yusuf Mohammed. Since establishing himself as an international, Ribéry has been involved in numerous promotional campaigns. For the 2008–09 season, he appeared, alongside international teammate Karim Benzema, on the French cover of video game ""FIFA 09"". Ribéry is sponsored by American sportswear company Nike and regularly wears Nike Mercurial Vapors. He has appeared in several television advertisements for the brand and, during the 2007–08 Bundesliga season, starred in a one-time television show called """"The Franck Ribéry Show"""", which aired on Direct 8 in France. The show, sponsored by Nike, acted as a variety show with Ribéry appearing in several sketches.  On 25 May 2010, a billboard of Ribéry was officially unveiled in his home city of Boulogne-sur-Mer ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The billboard paid tribute to a similar billboard that was erected for Zinedine Zidane in his home city of Marseille during his career. The construction of the billboard was initially suspended due to possible image ramifications associated with Ribéry's alleged relationship with an underage prostitute. However, the Regional Council of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, which initially opposed the billboard, agreed to allow construction of the billboard. The billboard was a project of Ribéry's sponsor Nike and was on display for the duration of the FIFA World Cup. Alleged prostitute scandal. On 18 April 2010, it was first reported by French television service M6 that four members of the French national team were being investigated for their roles as clients of a prostitution ring that was being operated inside of a Paris nightclub with some of the women possibly being underage. The report also stated that two of the players were already questioned as witnesses by judge André Dando and a group of magistrates. The report described the two players as being one who ""is a major player in a big foreign club"" and that the other ""plays in the championship of France Ligue 1"". Later that day, the players were discovered to be Ribéry and Sidney Govou. During his interview with Dando, Ribéry reportedly admitted to having a relationship with a prostitute, but did not know that she was a minor at the time the relationship began.  On 29 April 2010, the country's Secretary of State for Sports Rama Yade, after refusing to publicly comment on the case in its infancy, declared that any player placed under investigation should not represent the France national team. The following day, a judicial source confirmed that Ribéry would not be placed under official investigation, if at all, before the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. On 20 July, Ribéry was questioned by Paris police and, following questioning, was indicted by judge Dando on the charge of ""solicitation of a minor prostitute"". In November 2011, prosecutors asked for the cases against Ribéry and Benzema to be dropped, saying that the players were not aware that the escort, identified as Zahia Dehar, was 16 years old when they had paid to have sex with her. Club career. Early career. Ribéry began his football career at age six playing in the youth section of amateur club ""FC Conti de Boulogne-sur-Mer"". After a seven-year stay, in 1996, he joined professional outfit Lille, who were playing in the second division. While at Lille, Ribéry excelled athletically, but developed academic and behavioral problems, which led to Lille releasing him. In 2012, during a press conference ahead of Bayern Munich's Champions League tie against his former club Lille, Ribéry explained that he was released from the Lille academy after suffering a broken elbow and that Lille officials had previously wanted to drop him from the academy for being ""too small"".  After leaving Lille, Ribéry returned to his hometown joining the biggest club in the city, US Boulogne. After spending a year in the reserves, he was promoted to the senior team. Ribéry only made four appearances in his debut season as Boulogne, who were playing in the CFA, the fourth division of French football, earned promotion to third-tier Championnat National. In his second season with the club, Ribéry appeared in 25 league matches converting five goals. Though Boulogne finished 17th, which meant a return to the fourth division, Ribéry's solid performances earned him a move to fellow National club Olympique Alès. In his only season at the club, Ribéry made 18 appearances scoring only one goal. Following the season, despite finishing safe, Alès were relegated to the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, by the DNCG after the club declared bankruptcy. The resulting news led to Ribéry signing with Stade Brest, another Championnat National club. At Brest, Ribéry established himself as a premier player in the league appearing in 35 league matches scoring three goals.

Ribéry primarily plays as a winger and is described as a player who is ""fast, tricky, and an excellent dribbler who has great control with the ball at his feet"". Despite being predominantly right-footed and utilized as a right-sided midfielder during his development years in France, since establishing himself as an international and at Bayern, Ribéry has personally admitted that his preference is to play on the left wing even going as far as to state ""My place is on the left"" when asked at a February 2010 media session while on international duty. Though he is often played on the left wing domestically, Ribéry has struggled to establish himself as a left winger at international level with France due to the presence of left-footed dominant players such as Florent Malouda. Ribéry has declared that he is best utilized on the left side because ""that is where I am most free and I am the best in my head"". Playing on the left also allows Ribéry to use his ""bursts of acceleration and weaving runs"" to effectively cut inside, which gives him the options of either shooting or delivering a decisive pass. Ribéry is also capable of playing in the center of the field as an attacking midfielder where his vision and playmaking skills are best exhibited. Despite predominantly playing on the wing, he has averaged double-digits in assists every year beginning with his final season at Marseille. Ribéry has been described as a provocateur on the field of play with UEFA describing him as ""a crowd-pleaser – one of those rare breed of footballer capable of enjoying his talents while expressing them"". During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he was mentored by national team play-maker Zinedine Zidane. While boasting him as ""the jewel of French football"", Zidane has also praised Ribéry as a person declaring ""Franck just loves life. He’s the kind of player that makes an impression every time he plays. He’s bound to become an important figure in the world of football"".  Ribéry's on-field personality is often matched off-field as he is often referred to as a ""joker"" and ""prankster"" by club and international teammates. The midfielder has stated that humour is very important admitting ""It's important to always be smiling, to wake up and feel good. We (footballers) have a great job, we like what we do and we have fun. His more notable stunts include driving a tractor on field during one of his last matches with Marseille, in his debut season with Bayern, emptying a bucket of water over former club goalkeeper Oliver Kahn from the roof of the club's training centre, and, during the 2008–09 winter break, commandeering the team bus while in Dubai and crashing it. On the negative front, Ribéry has often struggled with injury issues. Since his first season at Bayern in which he appeared in 46 of the club's 54 competitive matches, Ribéry has struggled with minor and serious injuries that has resulted in the player failing to appear in over 40 matches in subsequent seasons; the midfielder passed the 40-match barrier in the 2011–12 season after failing to in the previous three seasons. Ahead of the 2008–09 season, he tore ligaments in one of his ankles while on international duty and, during the 2009–10 season, struggled with tendinitis in his left knee. In the next season, Ribéry suffered an ankle injury, which resulted in the midfielder missing two months, despite the initial diagnosis ruling him out for four weeks. He later suffered a similar ankle injury at the start of the 2011–12 season. Ribéry, himself, has admitted that injuries have led to most of his five-year career at Bayern being difficult stating in July 2011 ""The last two years (2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons) have been more difficult, partly because I kept picking up injuries. The important thing for me now is to avoid any more injuries"".  "

Anaerobic bacteria have been implicated in tonsillitis and a possible role in the acute inflammatory process is supported by several clinical and scientific observations. Under normal circumstances, as viruses and bacteria enter the body through the nose and mouth, they are filtered in the tonsils. Within the tonsils, white blood cells of the immune system destroy the viruses or bacteria by producing inflammatory cytokines like Phospholipase A2, which also lead to fever. The infection may also be present in the throat and surrounding areas, causing inflammation of the pharynx.  Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by an infection of spirochaeta and treponema, in this case called Vincent's angina or Plaut-Vincent angina. Diagnosis. The diagnosis of GABHS tonsillitis can be confirmed by culture of samples obtained by swabbing both tonsillar surfaces and the posterior pharyngeal wall and plating them on sheep blood agar medium. The isolation rate can be increased by incubating the cultures under anaerobic conditions and using selective growth media. A single throat culture has a sensitivity of 90%-95% for the detection of GABHS (which means that GABHS is actually present 5%-10% of the time culture suggests that it is absent). This small percentage of false-negative results are part of the characteristics of the tests used but are also possible if the patient has received antibiotics prior to testing. Identification requires 24 to 48 hours by culture but rapid screening tests (10–60 minutes), which have a sensitivity of 85-90%, are available. Older antigen tests detect the surface Lancefield group A carbohydrate. Newer tests identify GABHS serotypes using nucleic acid (DNA) probes or polymerase chain reaction. Bacterial culture may need to be performed in cases of a negative rapid streptococcal test. True infection with GABHS, rather than colonization, is defined arbitrarily as the presence of >10 colonies of GABHS per blood agar plate. However, this method is difficult to implement because of the overlap between carriers and infected patients. An increase in antistreptolysin O (ASO) streptococcal antibody titer 3–6 weeks following the acute infection can provide retrospective evidence of GABHS infection and is considered definitive proof of GABHS infection. Increased values of secreted Phospholipase A2, and altered fatty acid metabolism in patients with tonsillitis may have diagnostic usefulness. Treatment. Treatments to reduce the discomfort from tonsillitis symptoms include: If the tonsillitis is caused by group A streptococcus, then antibiotics are useful with penicillin or amoxicillin being primary choices. Cephalosporins and macrolides are considered good alternatives to penicillin in the acute setting. A macrolide such as erythromycin is used for people allergic to penicillin. Individuals who fail penicillin therapy may respond to treatment effective against beta-lactamase producing bacteria such as clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. Aerobic and anaerobic beta lactamase producing bacteria that reside in the tonsillar tissues can ""shield"" group A streptococcus from penicillins.  When tonsillitis is caused by a virus, the length of illness depends on which virus is involved. Usually, a complete recovery is made within one week; however, symptoms may last for up to two weeks. Chronic cases may be treated with tonsillectomy (surgical removal of tonsils) as a choice for treatment. Prognosis. Since the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, a major preoccupation in the treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis has been the prevention of rheumatic fever, and its major effects on the nervous system (Sydenham's chorea) and heart. Recent evidence would suggest that the rheumatogenic strains of group A beta hemolytic strep have become markedly less prevalent and are now only present in small pockets such as in Salt Lake City. This brings into question the rationale for treating tonsillitis as a means of preventing rheumatic fever. Complications may rarely include dehydration and kidney failure due to difficulty swallowing, blocked airways due to inflammation, and pharyngitis due to the spread of infection. An abscess may develop lateral to the tonsil during an infection, typically several days after the onset of tonsillitis. This is termed a peritonsillar abscess (or quinsy). Rarely, the infection may spread beyond the tonsil resulting in inflammation and infection of the internal jugular vein giving rise to a spreading septicaemia infection (Lemierre's syndrome). In chronic/recurrent cases (generally defined as seven episodes of tonsillitis in the preceding year, five episodes in each of the preceding two years or three episodes in each of the preceding three years), or in acute cases where the palatine tonsils become so swollen that swallowing is impaired, a tonsillectomy can be performed to remove the tonsils. Patients whose tonsils have been removed are still protected from infection by the rest of their immune system. In strep throat, very rarely diseases like rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis can occur. These complications are extremely rare in developed nations but remain a significant problem in poorer nations. Tonsillitis associated with strep throat, if untreated, is hypothesized to lead to pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). "
Hepatitis B," Hepatitis B vaccine  Hepatitis B vaccine is a vaccine developed for the prevention of hepatitis B virus infection. The vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It is produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBsAg has been inserted. A course of two to three (2–3) vaccine injections are given, the second injection at least one month after the first dose and the third injection being administered six months after the first dose. The first and second dose offer complete protection. The final injection (second or third depending on number of vaccines being administered) is to prolong protection against the hepatitis B virus. Afterward an immune system antibody to HBsAg is established in the bloodstream. The antibody is known as ""anti-HBsAg"". This antibody and immune system memory then provide immunity to hepatitis B infection. The first vaccine became available in 1981. A range of vaccines is available in the market. Presently recombinant DNA vaccines are available, which means they are produced by inserting the gene for HBV into common baker's yeast where it is grown, harvested, and purified. HBV infection cannot occur from receiving hepatitis B vaccine. The common brands available are Recombivax HB (Merck), Engerix-B (GSK), Elovac B (Human Biologicals Institute, a division of Indian Immunologicals Limited), Genevac B (Serum Institute), Shanvac B, etc. These vaccines are given intramuscularly. The invention. The invention of the vaccine began with the realization (by virologist Alfred Prince, in 1968) that the Australia antigen was part of a virus that caused hepatitis B. Maurice Hilleman at Merck used three treatments (pepsin, urea and formaldehyde) of blood serum together with rigorous filtration to yield a product that could be used as a safe vaccine. Hilleman hypothesized that he could make an HBV vaccine by injecting patients with hepatitis B surface protein. In theory, this would be very safe, as these excess surface proteins lacked infectious viral DNA. The immune system, recognizing the surface proteins as foreign, would manufacture specially shaped antibodies, custom-made to bind to, and destroy, these proteins. Then, in the future, if the patient were infected with hepatitis B virus, the immune system could promptly deploy protective antibodies, destroying the viruses before they could do any harm. Hilleman collected blood from gay men and intravenous drug users—groups known to be at risk for HBV infections. This was in the late 1970s, when HIV was yet unknown to medicine. In addition to the sought-after hepatitis B surface proteins, the blood samples likely contained HIV. Hilleman devised a multistep process to purify this blood so that only the hepatitis B surface proteins remained. Every known virus was killed by this process, and Hilleman was confident that the vaccine was safe. The first large-scale trials for the blood-derived vaccine were performed on gay men, considered to be an at-risk group. Later, Hilleman’s vaccine was falsely blamed for igniting the AIDS epidemic. But, although the purified blood vaccine seemed questionable, it was determined to have indeed been free of HIV. The purification process had destroyed all viruses—including HIV. The vaccine was approved in 1981. It was withdrawn from the marketplace when Pablo DT Valenzuela, Research Director of Chiron Corporation succeeded in 1986 in making the antigen in yeast and invented the first recombinant vaccine. The recombinant vaccine was developed by inserting the HBV gene that codes for the surface protein into a species of yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allows the yeast to produce only the noninfectious surface protein, without any danger of introducing actual viral DNA into the final product. This is the vaccine still in use today. Recommended populations. Babies born to mothers who've had the hepatitis virus are vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine and injected with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). Many countries now routinely vaccinate infants against hepatitis B. In countries with high rates of hepatitis B infection, vaccination of newborns has not only reduced the risk of infection, but has also led to marked reduction in liver cancer. This was reported in Taiwan where the implementation of a nationwide hepatitis B vaccination program in 1984 was associated with a decline in the incidence of childhood hepatocellular carcinoma.  In many areas, vaccination against hepatitis B is also required for all health-care and laboratory staff. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis B among patients with diabetes mellitus. Response to vaccination. Following the primary course of 3 vaccinations, a blood test may be taken after an interval of 1–4 months to establish if there has been an adequate response, which is defined as an anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-Hbs) antibody level above 100 mIU/ml. Such a full response occurs in about 85–90% of individuals. An antibody level between 10 and 100 mIU/ml is considered a poor response, and these people should receive a single booster vaccination at this time, but do not need further retesting. People who fail to respond (anti-Hbs antibody level below 10 mIU/ml) should be tested to exclude current or past Hepatitis B infection, and given a repeat course of 3 vaccinations, followed by further retesting 1–4 months after the second course. Those who still do not respond to a second course of vaccination may respond to intradermal administration or to a high dose vaccine or to a double dose of a combined Hepatitis A and B vaccine. Those who still fail to respond will require hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) if later exposed to the hepatitis B virus. Poor responses are mostly associated with being over the age of 40 years, obesity and smoking, and also in alcoholics, especially if with advanced liver disease. Patients who are immunosuppressed or on renal dialysis may respond less well and require larger or more frequent doses of vaccine. At least one study suggests that hepatitis B vaccination is less effective in patients with HIV. Duration of protection. It is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection. However, it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective cover of between five and seven years, but subsequently it has been appreciated that long-term immunity derives from immunological memory which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals. Hence with the passage of time and longer experience, protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations, and UK guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection, such as for healthcare workers, only a single booster is advocated at 5 years. Safety. Several studies looked for a significant association between recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults. Most published scientific studies do not support a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccination and demyelinating diseases such as MS. A 2004 study reported a significant increase in risk within 3 years of vaccination. Some of these studies were criticized for methodological problems. This controversy created public misgivings about HB vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination in children remained low in several countries. A 2007 study found that the vaccination does not seem to increase the risk of a first episode of MS in childhood. A 2009 study of the hepatitis B vaccine and associated risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination was conducted. The hepatitis B vaccine was found to be generally safe, however the Engerix B vaccine appeared to triple the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in infant boys. There have been numerous reports that the Hepatitis B vaccine is linked to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a syndrome marked by severe fatigue, brain fogs, and muscle pains among other symptoms.  The Engerix B vaccine contained Thiomersal, a mercury containing vaccine preservative that is being phased out at the urging of the Public Health Service in the US. The World Health Organization recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and ""Haemophilus influenzae"" type B with the vaccine against hepatitis B. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines. "
Doxycycline," Doxycycline  Doxycycline (IPA: ) is a member of the tetracycline antibiotics group, and is commonly used to treat a variety of infections. Vibramycin received US Food and Drug Administration approval in 1967. Other brand names include Monodox, Microdox, Periostat, Vibra-Tabs, Oracea, Doryx, Vibrox, Adoxa, Doxyhexal, Doxylin, Doxoral, Doxy-1 and Atridox (topical doxycycline hyclate for periodontitis). Medical uses. In addition to the general indications for all members of the tetracycline antibiotics group, doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease, chronic prostatitis, sinusitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, acne, rosacea, and rickettsial infections. Antiprotozoal. It is used in prophylaxis against malaria. It should not be used alone for initial treatment of malaria, even when the parasite is doxycycline-sensitive, because the antimalarial effect of doxycycline is delayed. This delay is related to its mechanism of action, which is to specifically impair the progeny of the apicoplast genes, resulting in their abnormal cell division. It can be used in a treatment plan in combination with other agents, such as quinine. Antibacterial. ""Branhamella catarrhalis"", ""Brucella melitensis"", ""Chlamydia pneumoniae"", and ""Mycoplasma pneumoniae"" are generally susceptible to doxycycline, while some ""Haemophilus"" spp., ""Mycoplasma hominis"", and ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"" have developed resistance to varying degrees. It is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of anthrax (caused by ""Bacillus anthracis"") and Leptospirosis. It is also effective against ""Yersinia pestis"" (the infectious agent of bubonic plague), and is prescribed for the treatment of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In fact, because doxycycline is one of the few medications shown to be effective in treating Rocky Mountain spotted fever (with the next-best alternative being chloramphenicol), doxycycline is indicated even for use in children for this illness. Otherwise, it is not indicated for use in children under the age of eight years.  When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug, doxycycline may be used to treat and prevent: Antihelminthic. Doxycycline kills the symbiotic ""Wolbachia"" bacteria in the reproductive tracts of parasitic filarial nematodes, making the nematodes sterile, and thus reducing transmission of diseases such as onchocerciasis and elephantiasis. Field trials in 2005 showed an eight-week course of doxycycline almost completely eliminates the release of microfilariae. Adverse effects. Cautions and side effects are similar to those of other members of the tetracycline antibiotic group. An erythematous rash in sun-exposed parts of the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.  Unlike some other members of the tetracycline group, it may be used in those with renal impairment. Interactions. The combination of doxycycline with dairy, antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium is not inherently dangerous, but any of these foods and supplements may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness. Previously, doxycycline was believed to impair the effectiveness of many types of hormonal contraception due to CYP450 induction. Recent research has shown no significant loss of effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most tetracycline antibiotics (including doxycycline), although many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking the drug to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Pharmacokinetics. Doxycycline–metal ion complexes are unstable at acid pH, therefore more doxycycline enters the duodenum for absorption compared with the earlier tetracycline compounds. In addition, food has less effect on absorption than on absorption of earlier drugs with doxycycline serum concentrations being reduced by ?20% by test meals compared with 50% for tetracycline. Physical and chemical properties. Expired tetracyclines or tetracyclines allowed to stand at a pH less than 2 are reported to be nephrotoxic due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline causing Fanconi syndrome. In the case of doxycycline, the absence of a hydroxyl group in C-6 prevents the formation of the nephrotoxic compound. Nevertheless, tetracyclines and doxycycline itself have to be taken with precaution in patients with kidney injury, as they can worsen azotemia due to catabolic effects. Experimental applications. At subantimicrobial doses, doxycycline is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases, and has been used in various experimental systems for this purpose, such as for recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions. Doxycycline has been demonstrated to reduce the ""in vitro"" growth of human breast and prostate cancer cells, possibly through G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Doxycycline and other tetracyclines are also highly osteotropic, and in animal models of breast cancer bone metastases, doxycycline treatments have reduced the growth of breast cancer tumours in the bone. Doxycycline has been used successfully in the treatment of one patient with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, an otherwise progressive and fatal disease. It has also been shown to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy (in mice), a deadly consequence of prolonged hypertension. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, doxycycline has been shown to improve lung functions in patients with stable symptoms. Doxycycline is also used in ""Tet-on"" and ""Tet-off"" tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation to regulate transgene expression in organisms and cell cultures. Other experimental applications include treating: History. Doxycycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline invented and clinically developed in the early 1960s by Pfizer Inc. and marketed under the brand name Vibramycin. "
Leukemia," Leukemia inhibitory factor  Leukemia inhibitory factor, or LIF, is an interleukin 6 class cytokine that affects cell growth by inhibiting differentiation. When LIF levels drop, the cells differentiate. Function. LIF derives its name from its ability to induce the terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells, thus preventing their continued growth. Other properties attributed to the cytokine include: the growth promotion and cell differentiation of different types of target cells, influence on bone metabolism, cachexia, neural development, embryogenesis and inflammation. p53 regulated LIF has been shown to facilitate implantation in the mouse model and possibly in humans. It has been suggested that recombinant human LIF might help to improve the implantation rate in women with unexplained infertility. Binding/activation. LIF binds to the specific LIF receptor (LIFR-?) which forms a heterodimer with a specific subunit common to all members of that family of receptors, the GP130 signal transducing subunit. This leads to activation of the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) and MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) cascades. Expression. LIF is normally expressed in the trophectoderm of the developing embryo, with its receptor LIFR expressed throughout the inner cell mass. As embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass at the blastocyst stage, removing them from the inner cell mass also removes their source of LIF. Use in stem cell culture. Removal of LIF pushes stem cells toward differentiation, but they retain their proliferative potential or pluripotency. Therefore LIF is used in mouse embryonic stem cell culture. It is necessary to maintain the stem cells in an undifferentiated state, however genetic manipulation of embryonic stem cells allows for LIF independent growth, notably overexpression of the gene Nanog.  LIF is not required for culture of human embryonic stem cells. "
Gout," Gout  Gout (also known as podagra when it involves the big toe) is a medical condition usually characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis—a red, tender, hot, swollen joint. The metatarsal-phalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is the most commonly affected (approximately 50% of cases). However, it may also present as tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy. It is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. The uric acid crystallizes, and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues. Clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by seeing the characteristic crystals in joint fluid. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once the acute attack subsides, levels of uric acid are usually lowered via lifestyle changes, and in those with frequent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provide long-term prevention.  Gout has become more common in recent decades, affecting about 1–2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. The increase is believed due to increasing risk factors in the population, such as metabolic syndrome, longer life expectancy and changes in diet. Gout was historically known as ""the disease of kings"" or ""rich man's disease"". Signs and symptoms. Gout can present in a number of ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4 hours and during the night. The reason for onset at night is due to the lower body temperature then. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever. Long-standing elevated uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) may result in other symptomatology, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy. Cause. High levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur for a number of reasons, including diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Renal underexcretion of uric acid is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530 ?mol/l (7 and 8.9 mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535 ?mol/l (9 mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year. Lifestyle. Dietary causes account for about 12% of gout, and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, fructose-sweetened drinks, meat, and seafood. Other triggers include physical trauma and surgery. Recent studies have found that other dietary factors once believed associated are, in fact, not, including the intake of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) and total protein. The consumption of coffee, vitamin C and dairy products, as well as physical fitness, appear to decrease the risk. This is believed partly due to their effect in reducing insulin resistance. Genetics. The occurrence of gout is partly genetic, contributing to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. Three genes called ""SLC2A9"", ""SLC22A12"" and ""ABCG2"" have been found to commonly be associated with gout, and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss of function mutations in ""SLC2A9"" and ""SLC22A12"" cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. A few rare genetic disorders, including familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout. Medical conditions. Gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include: polycythemia, lead poisoning, renal failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, and solid organ transplants. A body mass index greater than or equal to 35 increases a male's risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis. Medication. Diuretics have been associated with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase the risk. Other medicines that increase the risk include niacin and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Pathophysiology. Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes in the form of monosodium urate, precipitating in joints, on tendons, and in the surrounding tissues. These crystals then trigger a local immune-mediated inflammatory reaction, with one of the key proteins in the inflammatory cascade being interleukin 1?. An evolutionary loss of uricase, which breaks down uric acid, in humans and higher primates has made this condition common. The triggers for precipitation of uric acid are not well understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as levels increase. Other factors believed important in triggering an acute episode of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration, and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens, and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to a number of factors, including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics, and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout as compared to other medications for hypertension.  Diagnosis. Gout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic podagra. Synovial fluid analysis should be done, however, if the diagnosis is in doubt. X-rays, while useful for identifying chronic gout, have little utility in acute attacks. Synovial fluid. A definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or a tophus. All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed inflamed joints should be examined for these crystals. Under polarized light microscopy, they have a needle-like morphology and strong negative birefringence. This test is difficult to perform, and often requires a trained observer. The fluid must also be examined relatively quickly after aspiration, as temperature and pH affect their solubility. Blood tests. Hyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout, but it occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia, and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the diagnostic utility of measuring uric acid level is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 ?mol/l (7.0 mg/dl) in males and 360 ?mol/l (6.0 mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, renal function, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented. Differential diagnosis. The most important differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that look similar include pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma, or other neoplasms. Prevention. Both lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of food such as meat and seafood, consuming adequate vitamin C, limiting alcohol and fructose consumption, and avoiding obesity. A low-calorie diet in obese men decreased uric acid levels by 100 µmol/l (1.7 mg/dl). Vitamin C intake of 1,500 mg per day decreases the risk of gout by 45%. Coffee, but not tea, consumption is associated with a lower risk of gout. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks. Treatment. The initial aim of treatment is to settle the symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by different drugs used to reduce the serum uric acid levels. Ice applied for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day decreases pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids, while options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of comorbidities is also important. NSAIDs. NSAIDs are the usual first-line treatment for gout, and no specific agent is significantly more or less effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours, and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, or heart failure. While indomethacin has historically been the most commonly used NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. Colchicine. Colchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. Its side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. Gastrointestinal upset, however, depends on the dose, and the risk can be decreased by using smaller yet still effective doses. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others. Steroids. Glucocorticoids have been found as effective as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint; a joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsens this condition. Pegloticase. Pegloticase (Krystexxa) was approved in the USA to treat gout in 2010. It is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and has been found to reduce uric acid levels in this population. Prophylaxis. A number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout, including xanthine oxidase inhibitor (including allopurinol and febuxostat) and uricosurics (including probenecid and sulfinpyrazone). They are not usually commenced until one to two weeks after an acute attack has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack, and are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first three to six months. They are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist, as medications have not been found cost effective until this point. Urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360 µmol/l (5.0–6.0 mg/dl), and are continued indefinitely. If these medications are being used chronically at the time of an attack, discontinuation is recommended. If levels cannot be brought below 6.0 mg/dl and there are recurrent attacks, this is deemed treatment failure or refractory gout. Overall, probenecid appears less effective than allopurinol.  Uricosuric medications are typically preferred if undersecretion of uric acid, as indicated by a 24-hour collection of urine results in a uric acid amount of less than 800 mg, is found. They are, however, not recommended if a person has a history of kidney stones. In a 24-hour urine excretion of more than 800 mg, which indicates overproduction, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor is preferred.  Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (including allopurinol and febuxostat) block uric acid production, and long-term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones, although allopurinol has caused hypersensitivity in a small number of individuals. In such cases, the alternative drug, febuxostat, has been recommended. Prognosis. Without treatment, an acute attack of gout usually resolves in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout are at increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and renal and cardiovascular disease, thus are at increased risk of death. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent. Without treatment, episodes of acute gout may develop into chronic gout with destruction of joint surfaces, joint deformity, and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% of those who are untreated for five years, often in the helix of the ear, over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people, and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic renal dysfunction may occur. Epidemiology. Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western population at some point in their lifetimes, and is becoming more common. Rates of gout have approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet, and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. A number of factors have been found to influence rates of gout, including age, race, and the season of the year. In men over the age of 30 and women over the age of 50, prevalence is 2%. In the United States, gout is twice as likely in African American males as it is in European Americans. Rates are high among the peoples of the Pacific Islands and the M?ori of New Zealand, but rare in Australian aborigines, despite a higher mean concentration of serum uric acid in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia, and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies have found attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This has been attributed to seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and temperature. History. The word ""gout"" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the Latin word ""gutta"", meaning ""a drop"" (of liquid). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and ""the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints"". Gout has, however, been known since antiquity. Historically, it has been referred to as ""the king of diseases and the disease of kings"" or ""rich man's disease"". The first documentation of the disease is from Egypt in 2,600 BC in a description of arthritis of the big toe. The Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 BC commented on it in his ""Aphorisms"", noting its absence in eunuchs and premenopausal women. Aulus Cornelius Celsus (30 AD) described the linkage with alcohol, later onset in women, and associated kidney problems: Again thick urine, the sediment from which is white, indicates that pain and disease are to be apprehended in the region of joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and venery. In 1683, Thomas Sydenham, an English physician, described its occurrence in the early hours of the morning, and its predilection for older males: Gouty patients are, generally, either old men, or men who have so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery, and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o'clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation, and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers, and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected, and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint, and being worse as the fit comes on. The Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described the microscopic appearance of urate crystals in 1679. In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod realized this excess uric acid in the blood was the cause of gout. Other animals. Gout is rare in most other animals due to their ability to produce uricase, which breaks down uric acid. Humans and other great apes do not have this ability, thus gout is common. The ""Tyrannosaurus rex"" specimen known as ""Sue"", however, is believed to have suffered from gout. Research. A number of new medications are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers an autoimmune response. Less antigenic versions are in development. "
Hepatitis C," Hepatitis C  Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis, which is generally apparent after many years. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will go on to develop liver failure, liver cancer or life-threatening esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment and transfusions. An estimated 150–200 million people worldwide are infected with . The existence of (originally ""non-A non-B hepatitis"") was postulated in the 1970s and proven in 1989. infects only humans and chimpanzees. The virus persists in the liver in about 85% of those infected. This persistent infection can be treated with medication: the standard therapy is a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin, with either boceprevir or telaprevir added in some cases. Overall, 50–80% of people treated are cured. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. No vaccine against is available. Signs and symptoms. Chronic infection. About 80% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection. This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months. Most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of the infection, although chronic can be associated with fatigue. Chronic infection after several years may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer. The liver enzymes are normal in 7-53%. Fatty changes to the liver occur in about half of those infected and are usually present before cirrhosis develops. Usually (80% of the time) this change affects less than a third of the liver. Worldwide hepatitis C is the cause of 27% of cirrhosis cases and 25% of hepatocellular carcinoma. About 10–30% of those infected develop cirrhosis over 30 years. Cirrhosis is more common in those also infected with hepatitis B, schistosoma, or HIV, in alcoholics and in those of male gender. In those with hepatitis C, excess alcohol increases the risk of developing cirrhosis 100-fold. Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. This transformation occurs at a rate of 1–3% per year. Liver cirrhosis may lead to portal hypertension, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen), easy bruising or bleeding, varices (enlarged veins, especially in the stomach and esophagus), jaundice, and a syndrome of cognitive impairment known as hepatic encephalopathy. Ascites occurs at some stage in more than half of those who have a chronic infection. Late relapses after apparent cure have been reported, but these can be difficult to distinguish from reinfection. Extrahepatic complications. The most common problem due to but not involving the liver is mixed cryoglobulinemia (usually the type II form) - an inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels. is also associated with Sjögren's syndrome (an autoimmune disorder); thrombocytopenia; lichen planus; porphyria cutanea tarda; necrolytic acral erythema; insulin resistance; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; autoimmune thyroiditis and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Thrombocytopenia is estimated to occur in 0.16% to 45.4% of people with chronic . 20-30% of people infected have rheumatoid factor - a type of antibody. Possible associations include Hyde's prurigo nodularis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Cardiomyopathy with associated arrhythmias has also been reported. A variety of central nervous system disorders have been reported. Chronic infection seems to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Occult infection. Persons who have been infected with hepatitis C may appear to clear the virus but remain infected. The virus is not detectable with conventional testing but can be found with ultra-sensitive tests. The original method of detection was by demonstrating the viral genome within liver biopsies, but newer methods include an antibody test for the virus' core protein and the detection of the viral genome after first concentrating the viral particles by ultracentrifugation. A form of infection with persistently moderately elevated serum liver enzymes but without antibodies to hepatitis C has also been reported. This form is known as cryptogenic occult infection.  Several clinical pictures have been associated with this type of infection. It may be found in people with anti-hepatitis-C antibodies but with normal serum levels of liver enzymes; in antibody-negative people with ongoing elevated liver enzymes of unknown cause; in healthy populations without evidence of liver disease; and in groups at risk for HCV infection including those on haemodialysis or family members of people with occult HCV. The clinical relevance of this form of infection is under investigation. The consequences of occult infection appear to be less severe than with chronic infection but can vary from minimal to hepatocellular carcinoma.  The rate of occult infection in those apparently cured is controversial but appears to be low. 40% of those with hepatitis but with both negative hepatitis C serology and the absence of detectable viral genome in the serum have hepatitis C virus in the liver on biopsy. How commonly this occurs in children is unknown. Virology. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. It is a member of the ""Hepacivirus"" genus in the family ""Flaviviridae"". There are seven major genotypes of HCV, which are known as genotypes one to seven. The genotypes are divided into several subtypes with the number of subtypes depending on the genotype. In the United States, about 70% of cases are caused by genotype 1, 20% by genotype 2 and about 1% by each of the other genotypes. Genotype 1 is also the most common in South America and Europe.  The half life of the virus particles in the serum is around 3 hours and may be as short as 45 minutes. In an infected person, about 1012 virus particles are produced each day. In addition to replicating in the liver the virus can multiply in lymphocytes. Transmission. The primary route of transmission in the developed world is intravenous drug use (IDU), while in the developing world the main methods are blood transfusions and unsafe medical procedures. The cause of transmission remains unknown in 20% of cases; however, many of these are believed to be accounted for by IDU. Intravenous drug use. IDU is a major risk factor for in many parts of the world. Of 77 countries reviewed, 25 (including the United States) were found to have prevalences of in the intravenous drug user population of between 60% and 80%. Twelve countries had rates greater than 80%. It is believed that ten million intravenous drug users are infected with ; China (1.6 million), the United States (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million) have the highest absolute totals. Occurrence of among prison inmates in the United States is 10 to 20 times that of the occurrence observed in the general population; this has been attributed to high-risk behavior in prisons such as IDU and tattooing with nonsterile equipment. Healthcare exposure. Blood transfusion, transfusion of blood products, or organ transplants without HCV screening carry significant risks of infection. The United States instituted universal screening in 1992 and Canada instituted universal screening in 1990. This decreased the risk from one in 200 units to between one in 10,000 to one in 10,000,000 per unit of blood. This low risk remains as there is a period of about 11–70 days between the potential blood donor's acquiring and the blood's testing positive depending on the method. Some countries do not screen for due to the cost. Those who have experienced a needle stick injury from someone who was HCV positive have about a 1.8% chance of subsequently contracting the disease themselves. The risk is greater if the needle in question is hollow and the puncture wound is deep. There is a risk from mucosal exposures to blood; but this risk is low, and there is no risk if blood exposure occurs on intact skin. Hospital equipment has also been documented as a method of transmission of , including reuse of needles and syringes; multiple-use medication vials; infusion bags; and improperly sterilized surgical equipment, among others. Limitations in the implementation and enforcement of stringent standard precautions in public and private medical and dental facilities are known to be the primary cause of the spread of HCV in Egypt, the country with highest rate of infection in the world. Sexual intercourse. Whether can be transmitted through sexual activity is controversial. While there is an association between high-risk sexual activity and , it is not known whether transmission of the disease is due to drug use that has not been admitted to or sex (as risk factors). The majority of evidence supports there being no risk for monogamous heterosexual couples. Sexual practices that involve higher levels of trauma to the anogenital mucosa, such as anal penetrative sex, or that occur when there is a concurrent sexually transmitted infection, including HIV or genital ulceration, do present a risk. The United States government recommends condom use to prevent transmission in only those with multiple partners. Body modification. Tattooing is associated with two to threefold increased risk of . This can be due to either improperly sterilized equipment or contamination of the dyes being used. Tattoos or piercings performed either before the mid-1980s, ""underground,"" or nonprofessionally are of particular concern, since sterile techniques in such settings may be lacking. The risk also appears to be greater for larger tattoos. It is estimated that nearly half of prison inmates share unsterilized tattooing equipment. It is rare for tattoos in a licensed facility to be directly associated with HCV infection. Shared personal items. Personal-care items such as razors, toothbrushes, and manicuring or pedicuring equipment can be contaminated with blood. Sharing such items can potentially lead to exposure to HCV. Appropriate caution should be taken regarding any medical condition that results in bleeding, such as cuts and sores. HCV is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating or cooking utensils. Neither is it transmitted through food or water. Vertical transmission. Vertical transmission of from an infected mother to her child occurs in less than 10% of pregnancies. There are no measures that alter this risk. It is not clear when during pregnancy transmission occurs, but it may occur both during gestation and at delivery. A long labor is associated with a greater risk of transmission. There is no evidence that breast-feeding spreads HCV; however, to be cautious, an infected mother is advised to avoid breastfeeding if her nipples are cracked and bleeding, or her viral loads are high. Diagnosis. There are a number of diagnostic tests for , including HCV antibody enzyme immunoassay or ELISA, recombinant immunoblot assay, and quantitative HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCV RNA can be detected by PCR typically one to two weeks after infection, while antibodies can take substantially longer to form and thus be detected. Chronic is defined as infection with the virus persisting for more than six months based on the presence of its RNA. Chronic infections are typically asymptomatic during the first few decades, and thus are most commonly discovered following the investigation of elevated liver enzyme levels or during a routine screening of high-risk individuals. Testing is not able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections. Diagnosis in the infant is difficult as maternal antibodies may persist for up to 18 months. Serology. Liver enzymes are variable during the initial part of the infection and on average begin to rise at seven weeks after infection. The elevation of liver enzymes does not closely follow disease severity. Biopsy. Liver biopsies are used to determine the degree of liver damage present; however, there are risks from the procedure. The typical changes seen are lymphocytes within the parenchyma, lymphoid follicles in portal triad, and changes to the bile ducts. There are a number of blood tests available that try to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis and alleviate the need for biopsy. Screening. It is believed that only 5–50% of those infected in the United States and Canada are aware of their status. Testing is recommended in those at high risk, which includes injection drug users, those who have received blood transfusions before 1992, and those with tattoos. Screening is also recommended in those with elevated liver enzymes, as this is frequently the only sign of chronic hepatitis. Routine screening is not currently recommended in the United States. In 2012, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added a recommendation for a single screening test for those born between 1945 and 1965. Prevention. , no vaccine protects against contracting . However, there are a number under development and some have shown encouraging results. A combination of harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of new needles and syringes and treatment of substance use, decrease the risk of in intravenous drug users by about 75%. The screening of blood donors is important at a national level, as is adhering to universal precautions within healthcare facilities. In countries where there is an insufficient supply of sterile syringes, medications should be given orally rather than via injection (when possible). Treatment. HCV induces chronic infection in 50–80% of infected persons. Approximately 40–80% of these clear with treatment. In rare cases, infection can clear without treatment. Those with chronic are advised to avoid alcohol and medications toxic to the liver, and to be vaccinated for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended in those with accompanying cirrhosis.  Medications. In general, treatment is recommended for those with proven HCV infection liver abnormalities; , treatments consist of a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and the antiviral drug ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype. This results cure rates of between 70–80% for genotype 2 and 3, and 45 to 70% for other genotypes. When combined with ribavirin, pegylated interferon-alpha-2a may be superior to pegylated interferon-alpha-2b, though the evidence is not strong. Another agent, sofosbuvir, when combined with ribavirin, shows improved response rates in the 95% range for genotype 2. This benefit is somewhat offset by a greater rate of adverse effects. Combining either boceprevir or telaprevir with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa improves antiviral response for hepatitis C genotype 1. Adverse effects with treatment are common, with half of people getting flu like symptoms and a third experiencing emotional problems. Treatment during the first six months is more effective than once has become chronic. If someone develops a new infection and it has not cleared after eight to twelve weeks, 24 weeks of pegylated interferon is recommended. In people with thalassemia, ribavirin appears to be useful but increases the need for transfusions. Surgery. Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is a common reason for liver transplantion though the virus usually (80–90% of cases) recurs afterwards. Infection of the graft leads to 10–30% of people developing cirrhosis within five years. Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin post transplant decreases the risk of recurrence to 70%. Alternative medicine. Several alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to be helpful for including milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver. However, no alternative therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in , and no evidence exists that alternative therapies have any effect on the virus at all. Prognosis. [[Image:Hepatitis C world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Disability-adjusted life year for hepatitis C in 2004 per 100,000 inhabitants The responses to treatment is measured by sustained viral response and vary by HCV C genotype. A sustained response occurs in about 40-50% in people with HCV genotype 1 given 48 weeks of treatment. A sustained response is seen in 70-80% of people with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 with 24 weeks of treatment. A sustained response occurs about 65% in those with genotype 4 after 48 weeks of treatment. The evidence for treatment in genotype 6 disease is sparse and what evidence there is supports 48 weeks of treatment at the same doses used for genotype 1 disease. Successful treatment decreases the future risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by 75%. Epidemiology. It is estimated that 150–200 million people, or ~3% of the world's population, are living with chronic . About 3–4 million people are infected per year, and more than 350,000 people die yearly from hepatitis C-related diseases. During 2010 it is estimated that 16,000 people died from acute infections while 196,000 deaths occurred from liver cancer secondary to the infection. Rates have increased substantially in the 20th century due to a combination of intravenous drug abuse and reused but poorly sterilized medical equipment. Rates are high (>3.5% population infected) in Central and East Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, they are intermediate (1.5%-3.5%) in South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Andean, Central and Southern Latin America, Caribbean, Oceania, Australasia and Central, Eastern and Western Europe; and they are low ("
Prednisone," Prednisone  Prednisone is a synthetic corticosteroid drug that is particularly effective as an immunosuppressant drug. It is used to treat certain inflammatory diseases (such as moderate allergic reactions) and (at higher doses) some types of cancer, but has significant adverse effects. Because it suppresses the immune system, it leaves patients more susceptible to infections. Pharmacology. Prednisone has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to prednisolone. Medical uses. Prednisone is used for many different indications including: asthma, COPD, CIDP, rheumatic disorders, allergic disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, adrenocortical insufficiency, hypercalcemia due to cancer, thyroiditis, laryngitis, severe tuberculosis, urticaria (hives), lipid pneumonitis, pericarditis, multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, lupus, myasthenia gravis, poison oak exposure, and as part of a drug regimen to prevent rejection post organ transplant. Prednisone has also been used in the treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headaches and for severe aphthous ulcer. Prednisone is used as an antitumor drug. Prednisone is important in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and other hormone-sensitive tumors, in combination with other anticancer drugs. Prednisone is also used for the treatment of the Herxheimer reaction, which is common during the treatment of syphilis, and to delay the onset of symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and also for uveitis. The mechanism for the delay of symptoms is unknown. Because it suppresses the adrenals, it is also sometimes used in the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Prednisone is also used to treat sarcoidosis and lupus. Prednisone can also be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to potentiate renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large dose of loop diuretics. The mechanism is prednisone, as a glucocorticoid, can improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by increasing the density of natriuretic peptide receptor type A in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, inducing a potent diuresis. Side-effects. Short-term side-effects, as with all glucocorticoids, include high blood glucose levels (especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or on other medications that increase blood glucose, such as tacrolimus) and mineralocorticoid effects such as fluid retention. The mineralocorticoid effects of prednisone are minor, which is why it is not used in the management of adrenal insufficiency, unless a more potent mineralocorticoid is administered concomitantly. Additional short-term side-effects can include insomnia, euphoria and, rarely, mania (in particular, in those suffering from bipolar disorder). It can also cause depression or depressive symptoms and anxiety in some individuals. Long-term side-effects include Cushing's syndrome, steroid dementia syndrome, truncal weight gain, osteoporosis, glaucoma and cataracts, type II diabetes mellitus, and depression upon dose reduction or cessation. Dependency. Adrenal suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days. Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days, instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days, if the course of prednisone was short, but may take weeks or months if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an Addison crisis. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side-effects. Glucocorticoids act to inhibit-feedback of both the hypothalamus, decreasing corticotropin-releasing hormone and corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland, decreasing the amount of adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH. For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids. This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again. Industry. The pharmaceutical industry uses prednisone tablets for the calibration of dissolution testing equipment according to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). History. The first isolation and structure identifications of prednisone and prednisolone were done in 1950 by Arthur Nobile. The first commercially feasible synthesis of prednisone was carried out in 1955 in the laboratories of Schering Corporation, which later became Schering-Plough Corporation, by Arthur Nobile and coworkers. They discovered that cortisone could be microbiologically oxidized to prednisone by the bacterium ""Corynebacterium simplex."" The same process was used to prepare prednisolone from hydrocortisone. The enhanced adrenocorticoid activity of these compounds over cortisone and hydrocortisone was demonstrated in mice. Prednisone and prednisolone were introduced in 1955 by Schering and Upjohn, under the brand names Meticorten and Delta-Cortef, respectively. These prescription medicines are now available from a number of manufacturers as generic drugs. References. International Journal of Immunopharmacology, Vol. 7, Issue 5, 1985, pp 731–737 "
Fever," Fever to Tell  Fever to Tell is the debut album by Yeah Yeah Yeahs, released on April 29, 2003, through Interscope. It was produced by David Andrew Sitek and mixed by Alan Moulder.  ""Fever to Tell"" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album and was certified Gold in the UK. The video for ""Maps"" was nominated at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and the MTV2 Award. ""The New York Times"" chose ""Fever To Tell"" as the best album of the year. In June 2005, the album was ranked number 89 on ""Spin"" magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005. It is also featured in the book ""1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die"". In 2009, the album was named by ""Rolling Stone"", ""Pitchfork Media"", and ""NME"", the 28th, 24th, and 5th best album of the decade, respectively.  According to ""The Guardian"", the album has sold over 1 million copies worldwide. "
Gabapentin," Gabapentin enacarbil  Gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant (in USA), Regnite (in Japan), formerly known as XP-13512) is a prodrug for the anticonvulsant and analgesic drug gabapentin. It was designed for increased oral bioavailability over gabapentin, and human trials showed it to produce extended release of gabapentin with almost twice the overall bioavailability, especially when taken with a fatty meal. Gabapentin enacarbil has passed human clinical trials for the treatment of restless legs syndrome, and initial results have shown it to be well tolerated and reasonably effective. Gabapentin enacarbil was denied approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010, citing concerns about possible increased cancer risk shown by some animal studies. Similar concerns had been raised about gabapentin itself in the past, but were felt to be outweighed by its clinical utility as an anticonvulsant, whereas the treatment of restless legs syndrome was not seen to justify the same kind of risk. On April 6, 2011, Xenoport received FDA approval for Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe restless legs syndrome. On June 7, 2012, FDA approved Horizant for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults. "
Lymphoma," Lymphoma in animals  Lymphoma in animals is a type of cancer defined by a proliferation of malignant lymphocytes within solid organs such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver and spleen. The disease also may occur in the eye, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. It is also known as lymphosarcoma. Lymphoma in dogs. Lymphoma is one of the most common malignant tumors to occur in dogs. The cause is genetic, but there are also suspected environmental factors involved, including in one study an increased risk with the use of the herbicide 2,4-D. This risk was not confirmed in another study. Breeds that are commonly affected include Boxer, Scottish Terrier, Basset Hound, Airedale Terrier, Chow Chow, German Shepherd, Poodle, St. Bernard, Bulldog, Beagle, Rottweiler and Golden Retriever. The Golden Retriever is especially susceptible to developing lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1:8. Classification. The cancer is classified into low and high grade types. Classification is also based on location. The four location types are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, and extranodal (involving the kidney, central nervous system, skin, heart, or eye). Multicentric lymphoma, the most common type (by greater than 80 percent), is found in the lymph nodes, with or without involvement in the liver, spleen, or bone marrow. Mediastinal lymphoma occurs in the lymph nodes in the thorax and possibly the thymus. Gastrointestinal lymphoma occurs as either a solitary tumor or diffuse invasion of the stomach or intestines, with or without involvement in the surrounding lymph nodes, liver or spleen. Classification is further based on involvement of B-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes. Approximately 70 percent are B-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous lymphoma can be classified as epitheliotropic (closely conforming to the epidermis) or non-epitheliotropic. The epitheliotropic form is typically of T-cell origin and is also called mycosis fungoides. The non-epitheliotropic form is typically of B-cell origin. Signs and symptoms. General signs and symptoms include depression, fever, weight loss, loss of appetite, loss of hair or fur and vomiting. Lymphoma is the most common cancerous cause of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) in dogs. It can lead to the above signs and symptoms plus increased water drinking, increased urination, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercalcemia in these cases is caused by secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein. Multicentric lymphoma presents as painless enlargement of the peripheral lymph nodes. This is seen in areas such as under the jaw, the armpits, the groin, and behind the knees. Enlargement of the liver and spleen causes the abdomen to distend. Mediastinal lymphoma can cause fluid to collect around the lungs, leading to coughing and difficulty breathing. Hypercalcemia is most commonly associated with this type. Gastrointestinal lymphoma causes vomiting, diarrhea, and melena (digested blood in the stool). Low serum albumin levels and hypercalcemia can also occur. Lymphoma of the skin is an uncommon occurrence. The epitheliotropic form typically appears as itchy inflammation of the skin progressing to nodules and plaques. The non-epitheliotropic form can have a wide variety of appearances, from a single lump to large areas of bruised, ulcerated, hairless skin. The epitheliotropic form must be differentiated from similar appearing conditions such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, and lupus erythematosus. Signs for lymphoma in other sites depend on the location. Central nervous system involvement can cause seizures or paralysis. Eye involvement, seen in 20 to 25 percent of cases, can lead to glaucoma, uveitis, bleeding within the eye, retinal detachment, and blindness. Lymphoma in the bone marrow causes anemia, low platelet count, and low white blood cell count. Diagnosis. Biopsy of affected lymph nodes or organs confirms the diagnosis, although a needle aspiration of an affected lymph node can increase suspicion of the disease. X-rays, ultrasound, blood analysis, and bone marrow biopsy reveal other locations of the cancer. The stage of the disease is important to treatment and prognosis. Each stage is divided into those with systemic symptoms (loss of appetite, weight loss, etc.) and those without. Treatment. Complete cure is rare with lymphoma and treatment tends to be palliative, but long remission times are possible with chemotherapy. With effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months. Second remissions are shorter and harder to accomplish. Average survival is 9 to 12 months. The most common treatment is a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin. Other chemotherapy drugs such as chlorambucil, lomustine (CCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and mitoxantrone are sometimes used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs. In most cases, appropriate treatment protocols cause few side effects, but white blood cell counts must be monitored. Allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantations (as is commonly done in humans) have recently been shown to be a possible treatment option for dogs. Most of the basic research on transplantation biology was generated in dogs. Current cure rates using stem cell therapy in dogs approximates that achieved in humans, 40-50%. When cost is a factor, prednisone used alone can improve the symptoms dramatically, but it does not significantly affect the survival rate. The average survival times of dogs treated with prednisone and untreated dogs are both one to two months. Using prednisone alone can cause the cancer to become resistant to other chemotherapy agents, so it should only be used if more aggressive treatment is not an option. Isotretinoin can be used to treat cutaneous lymphoma. Prognosis. Untreated dogs have an average survival time of 60 days. Lymphoma with a histologic high grade generally respond better to treatment but have shorter survival times than dogs with low grade lymphoma. Dogs with B-lymphocyte tumors have a longer survival time than T-lymphocyte tumors. Mediastinal lymphoma has a poorer prognosis than other types, especially those with hypercalcemia. Clinical stage and substage have some prognostic value, with poorer prognosis associated with Stage V disease, and with substage b (clinical illness at time of presentation).  Lymphoma in cats. Lymphoma is the most common malignancy diagnosed in cats. Lymphoma in young cats occurs most frequently following infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or to a lesser degree feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). These cats tend to have involvement of lymph nodes, spine, or mediastinum. Cats with FeLV are 62 times more likely to develop lymphoma, and cats with both FeLV and FIV are 77 times more likely. Younger cats tend to have T-cell lymphoma and older cats tend to have B-cell lymphoma. Older cats tend to have gastrointestinal lymphoma without FeLV infection, although tests more sensitive to low level FeLV infections and replication-defective FeLV have found that many of these cats have been previously exposed. The same forms of lymphoma that are found in dogs also occur in cats, but gastrointestinal is the most common type. Lymphoma of the kidney is the most common kidney tumor in cats, and lymphoma is also the most common heart tumor. Classification. Gastrointestinal lymphoma is classified into low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade. Low grade types include lymphocytic and small cell lymphoma. High grade types include lymphoblastic, immunoblastic, and large cell lymphoma. Low grade lymphoma is only found in the small intestine, while large grade can commonly be found in the stomach. Symptoms. Cats that develop lymphoma are much more likely to develop more severe symptoms than dogs. Whereas dogs often appear healthy initially except for swollen lymph nodes, cats will often be physically ill. The symptoms correspond closely to the location of the lymphoma. The most common sites for alimentary (gastrointestinal) lymphoma are, in decreasing frequency, the small intestine, the stomach, the junction of the ileum, cecum, and colon. Cats with the alimentary form of lymphoma often present with weight loss, rough hair coat, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea, although vomiting and diarrhea are commonly absent as symptoms. The tumor can also cause life-threatening blockage of the intestine. Cats with the mediastinal form often have respiratory distress and fluid in the thoracic cavity. If lymphoma develops in the kidney, the cat may have increased water consumption and increased urination. Lymphoma of the kidney presents as bilateral kidney enlargement and failure. If the lymphoma is located in the nose, the cat may have discharge from the nose and facial swelling. Lymphoma of the heart causes congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, and cardiac arrhythmias. Ocular lymphoma in cats often presents as anterior uveitis (inflammation of the inside of the eye). Cats who are also infected with FeLV often present with pale mucous membranes due to anemia. Anemia is a common problem in all cats with lymphoma, but hypercalcemia is rare. Diagnosis is similar to dogs, except cats should be tested for FeLV and FIV. It is important to differentiate the alimentary form of lymphoma from inflammatory bowel disease because the signs are so similar in cats. A biopsy is necessary to do this. One approach to differentiate inflammatory bowel disease from is to test the infiltrating lymphocytes for their monoclonal origin in lymphomas. Treatment and prognosis. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated with a combination of prednisolone and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis. About 75% of cats treated with chemotherapy for lymphoma do go into remission, unfortunately, most cats who have an initial remission relapse, and the median survival for a cat with lymphoma who is treated with chemotherapy is just 6 months. However, about one-third of cats treated with chemotherapy will survive more than 2 years after diagnosis, and a small number of these cats may be cured of their disease. Untreated, most cats with lymphoma die within 4–6 weeks. Most cats tolerate their chemotherapy well, and fewer than 5% have severe side effects. Cats do not lose their fur from chemotherapy, though loss of whiskers is possible. Other side effects include low white blood cell count, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, or fatigue, but these can typically be controlled well, and most cats have a good quality of life during treatment. If a cat relapses after attaining remission, the cat can be treated with different chemotherapy drugs to try to obtain a second remission, but the chances of obtaining a second remission are much lower than the chances of obtaining a first remission, and the second remission is often shorter than the first. Lymphoma in ferrets. Lymphoma is common in ferrets and is the most common cancer in young ferrets. There is some evidence that a retrovirus may play a role in the development of lymphoma like in cats. The most commonly affected tissues are the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, intestine, mediastinum, bone marrow, lung, and kidney. In young ferrets, the disease progresses rapidly. The most common symptom is difficulty breathing caused by enlargement of the thymus. Other symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, depression, and coughing. It can also masquerade as a chronic disease such as an upper respiratory infection or gastrointestinal disease. In older ferrets, lymphoma is usually chronic and can exhibit no symptoms for years. Symptoms seen are the same as in young ferrets, plus splenomegaly, abdominal masses, and peripheral lymph node enlargement. Diagnosis is through biopsy and x-rays. There may also be an increased lymphocyte count. Treatment includes surgery for solitary tumors, splenectomy (when the spleen is very large), and chemotherapy. The most common protocol uses prednisone, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. Doxorubicin is used in some cases. Chemotherapy in relatively healthy ferrets is tolerated very well, but possible side effects include loss of appetite, depression, weakness, vomiting, and loss of whiskers. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Prednisone used alone can work very well for weeks to months, but it may cause resistance to other chemotherapy agents. Alternative treatments include vitamin C and Pau d'Arco (a bark extract). The prognosis for lymphoma in ferrets depends on the their health and the location of the cancer. Lymphoma in the mediastinum, spleen, skin, and peripheral lymph nodes has the best prognosis, while lymphoma in the intestine, liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow has the worst. "

Arctic Monkeys," Arctic Monkeys  Arctic Monkeys are an English indie rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm/lead guitar), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.  The band have released five studio albums: ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" (2006), ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" (2007), ""Humbug"" (2009), ""Suck It and See"" (2011) and ""AM"" (2013), as well as one live album ""At the Apollo"" (2008). The band's debut album became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history, surpassing Elastica's self-titled album and remains the fastest-selling debut album by a group in the UK. The band have won five Brit Awards—winning Best British Group twice, and have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards. Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first group of acts to come to the public attention via the Internet (fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band are also regarded as one of the most prominent bands to be part of the post-punk revival in the UK, after achieving commercial success and spawning two number one singles with their debut album. History. Early years and record deal (2002–05). The band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend, and played their first gig on 13 June 2003 at ""The Grapes"" in Sheffield city-centre. After a few performances in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 17 songs were demoed in all and the collection, now known as ""Beneath the Boardwalk"", was burned on to CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name ""Beneath the Boardwalk"" originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that ""Beneath the Boardwalk"" was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this heading. The group did not mind the distribution, saying ""we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway – that was a better way for people to hear them."", admitting that they did not even know how to get their songs onto the Internet. When asked about the popularity of the band's MySpace site in an interview with ""Prefix Magazine"", the band said that they were unaware what it was, and that the site had originally been created by their fans. The band began to grow in popularity across the north of England, receiving attention from BBC Radio and the British tabloid press. A local amateur photographer, Mark Bull, filmed the band's performances and made the music video ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"", releasing it on his website, alongside the contents of ""Beneath the Boardwalk"" – a collection of the band's songs which he named after a local music venue. In May 2005, Arctic Monkeys released their first single, ""Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys"" on their own 'Bang Bang' label, featuring the songs ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" and ""From the Ritz to the Rubble"". This release was limited to 500 CDs and 1,000 7"" records, but was also available to download from the iTunes Music Store. Soon after, the band played at the Carling Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals, reserved for less known or unsigned bands. Their appearance was hyped by much of the music press and the band was watched by an unusually large crowd. Eventually, they signed to Domino in June 2005. The band said they were attracted to the DIY ethic of Domino owner Laurence Bell, who ran the label from his flat and only signed bands that he liked personally. The UK's ""Daily Star"" reported that this was followed in October by a £1 million publishing deal with EMI and a £725,000 contract with Epic Records for the United States. Arctic Monkeys denied this on their website, dubbing the newspaper ""The Daily Stir"". However, Domino have licensed the Australian and New Zealand publishing rights to EMI and the Japanese rights to independent label Hostess. Their first single with Domino, ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"", was released on 17 October 2005 and went straight to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, beating Sugababes and Robbie Williams. Two weeks previous to this, they made their first appearance on the cover of ""NME"". Their second single, ""When the Sun Goes Down"" (previously titled ""Scummy""), released on 16 January 2006, also went straight to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, selling 38,922 copies and taking over that position from Shayne Ward. The band's success with little marketing or advertising led some to suggest that it could signal a change in how new bands achieve recognition. ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" (2006). The band finished recording their debut album, ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"", at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire in September 2005 with Jim Abbiss producing. ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, selling 363,735 copies in the first week. This smashed the previous record of 306,631 copies held by ""Popstars"" by Hear’Say, and sold more copies on its first day alone – 118,501 – than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined. The cover sleeve of ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"", showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the NHS in Scotland for ""reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK"". The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and suggested the opposite – ""You can see from the image smoking is not doing him the world of good.""  The record was released a month later in the US and entered at No. 24 on the ""Billboard"" album chart after it sold 34,000 units in its first week, making it the second fastest selling for a debut indie rock album in America. However, US sales for the first year did not match those of the first week in the UK for the album. US critics were more reserved about the band than their UK counterparts, and appeared unwilling to be drawn into the possibility of ""yet another example of the UK's press over-hyping new bands"". However, the band's June 2006 tour of North America received critical acclaim at each stop – the hype surrounding them ""proven to exist for good reason"". Meanwhile, the UK's ""NME"" magazine declared the band's debut album the ""5th greatest British album of all time"". They also equalled the record of The Strokes and Oasis at the 2006 NME Awards, winning three fan-voted awards for Best British Band, Best New Band and Best Track for ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"". Arctic Monkeys wasted no time in recording new material, and released a five-track EP on 24 April 2006, titled ""Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?"". Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – ""since they made their name on the Internet... they don't care if they don't get radio play"". The release of the EP ""Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?"" just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by some, who have seen it as ""money-grabbing"" and ""cashing in on their success"". The band countered that they regularly release new music not to make money, but to avoid the ""boredom"" of ""spending three years touring on one album"". Soon after the release of the EP in the UK, the band announced that Andy Nicholson would not take part in the band's forthcoming North America tour due to fatigue from ""an intensive period of touring"". On returning to the UK, Nicholson confirmed that he would leave Arctic Monkeys and start his own project. He also said that he couldn't deal with the band's fame and the success over the previous six months. In a statement on their official website, the band said: ""We are sad to tell everyone that Andy is no longer with the band"", also confirmed that Nick O'Malley – former bassist with The Dodgems who had drafted in as temporary bassist for the tour – would continue as bassist for the rest of their summer tour schedule. Shortly after, Nick O'Malley was confirmed as the formal replacement for Nicholson. Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, the single ""Leave Before the Lights Come On"", came on 14 August 2006. Turner said that the song was one of the last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and suggested that ""it feels very much like it could be on the album"". Peaking at No. 4 in the UK, the single became the band's first failure to reach No. 1. The band was re-united at the Leeds Festival when Nicholson met up with his former band mates and his replacement bassist, O'Malley. Only the original band members, minus Nicholson, were present at the award ceremony when ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" won the 2006 Mercury Prize two weeks later. ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" (2007). The band's second album, ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"", was released on 23 April 2007, a week after the release of accompanying single ""Brianstorm"". Like its predecessor, ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" also went straight to No. 1 in the album charts. Turner described the songs as ""very different from last time"", adding that the sound of some tracks are ""a bit full-on – a bit like ""From the Ritz to the Rubble"", ""The View from the Afternoon"", that sort of thing."" A secret gig played at Sheffield's Leadmill on 10 February 2007, debuted seven new songs (six from ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" and one other). Early reviews of the release were positive, and described it as ""very, very fast and very, very loud."" Meanwhile, the band continued to pick up awards from around the world, namely the 'Best New Artist in the United States' at the PLUG Independent Music Awards, the ""Album of the Year"" awards in Japan, Ireland and the US, awards for ""Best Album"" and ""Best Music DVD"" at the 2007 NME Awards. They ended the year by clinching the ""Best British Band"" and ""Best British Album"" at the 2008 BRIT Awards. For the second year in a row, the band were nominated for the annual Mercury Prize, although they failed to match their feat of 2006 after the award went to Klaxons' ""Myths of the Near Future"". On 29 April 2007, the day ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" charted at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, all 12 tracks from the album charted in the Top 200 of the UK Singles Chart. On 27 April 2007 they had a total of 18 tracks in the Top 200. ""Fluorescent Adolescent"" and ""505"" charted in the Top 75, at No. 60 and No. 74 respectively. The band later released ""Fluorescent Adolescent"" as a single, and it charted at No. 5, after debuting the song live on The Jonathan Ross Show.  The third single from ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"", ""Teddy Picker"", was released on 3 December 2007. It charted at No. 20 and remained only one week in the top 40 staying in this position, making it the lowest charting single for the band so far. Prior to this release the band released an extremely limited number of 250 vinyl under the pseudonym The Death Ramps containing two of the b-sides from the ""Teddy Picker"" single. Arctic Monkeys headlined the Glastonbury Festival on 22 June 2007, the highlights of which were aired on BBC2. During their headline act, the band performed with Dizzee Rascal and Simian Mobile Disco and covered Shirley Bassey's ""Diamonds Are Forever"". The band also played a large gig at Dublin's Malahide Castle on 16 June 2007, with a second date added the following day. The band was also slated to play the Austin City Limits Music Festival in September 2007. Other European festivals include Rock Werchter in 2007. The band played two shows at Cardiff International Arena on 19 and 20 June 2007 supported by local friends of the band, Reverend and the Makers. They also played two London gigs at Alexandra Palace on 8 and 9 December 2007. On 1 September 2007 the band insisted on taking a working holiday to Ibiza where they played what turned out to be the last ever full live Ibiza Rocks show in Bar M (now Ibiza Rocks Bar). The band performed in front of 700 people in the bar by the beach whilst many thousands lined the beach outside unable to get a ticket – The Sun described this concert as the ""rock event of the summer"" stating that ""most people left saying they had just witnessed the best gig of their lives"". The band played their last show of the tour on 17 December 2007 at Manchester Apollo, which was filmed for the live DVD 'At The Apollo' which was released in cinemas the following year. ""Humbug"" (2008–10). After a brief hiatus during which Alex Turner toured and recorded with his side project The Last Shadow Puppets, the band recorded a total of 24 songs; 12 in the Rancho De La Luna recording sessions with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age in early autumn, 2008, and 12 in the New York sessions with James Ford in spring, 2009, following their January tour of New Zealand and Australia. During this tour, lead single ""Crying Lightning"", along with ""Humbug"" songs ""Pretty Visitors"", ""Dangerous Animals"", and ""Potion Approaching"" (then known as ""Go-Kart""), was debuted live. It was later revealed by Matt Helders in a video diary that the album would consist of 14 tracks and that Alex Turner would stay in New York to oversee the mixing of the material. However, the final tracklisting, revealed on 1 June 2009, listed only 10. In a preview article on ClashMusic.com, writer Simon Harper claimed that the band had ""completely defied any expectations or presumptions to explore the depths they can reach when stepping foot outside their accepted styles"", and that ""Turner is his usual eloquent self, but has definitely graduated into an incomparable writer whose themes twist and turn through stories and allegories so potent and profound it actually leaves one breathless"". On the same site, Alex Turner revealed that the band had listened to Nick Cave, Jimi Hendrix and Cream while writing the new album, the title of which would be ""Humbug"". ""Humbug"" was released on 19 August 2009, and, like both of its predecessors, the album went straight to No. 1. As announced on the Arctic Monkeys website the first single was ""Crying Lightning"", released on 6 July, digitally through iTunes and also received its first radio premiere on the same day. On 12 July 2009, the single ""Crying Lightning"" debuted at number 12 in the UK Singles Chart and number 1 on the UK Indie Chart. The second single, ""Cornerstone"", was released on 16 November 2009 to much critical acclaim, but failed to replicate the same success that every prior Arctic Monkeys single had, reaching a peak at position 94 on the UK singles chart.

Arctic Monkeys latest album 'AM', released 9 September 2013 in the UK, debuted at No. 1 in the UK album charts. Selling over 157,000 in its first week, this is the bands fifth consecutive No. 1 album, making history as the only independent band to have achieved this. Lead Singer Alex Turner describes 'AM' to be 'their most original yet', merging hip-hop drum beats, with 70's heavy rock. The frontman has said that track 4 'Arabella' expresses the two styles of the album most effectively in one track. On 'AM', Turner continues to experiment with unusual lyrics, and the album includes the words from poem 'I Wanna Be Yours' by John Cooper Clarke. A number of guest stars also appear on this album including Elvis Costello's drummer Pete Thomas, Bill Ryder-Jones of The Coral, and Josh Homme of Queens of The Stone Age. Turner has stated this appearance by Homme, who features on 'Kneesocks', marks his favourite moments of the whole album. The band will continue to tour 'AM' in the US and in the UK later in 2013. Musical style and influences. The band's music is known to fall under the umbrella of indie rock although they have changed their genre of rock on each album, which is one of the bands key features. Musically the band have expanded and altered their sound with each of their four albums making it difficult to pin a description to their style. Perhaps the key part of their sound and one that translates across their whole discography is lead singer and frontman Alex Turner's intricate and often rapidly-delivered lyrics, sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent that their music became famed for in their early years. Their early albums ""Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not"" and ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" were rooted in garage rock and post-punk revival, with Turner's sharp lyrics the focal point. On the first album Alex Turner examined human behaviour in nightclubs and in the culture of the band's hometown, Sheffield. Turner describes ""Dancing Shoes"" as being about ""people always looking to pull when they go out however much they mask it."" These themes continued on the following album ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" with the band still progressing as musicians. Songs such as ""Fluorescent Adolescent"" and ""Do Me a Favour"" explored failed relationships, nostalgia and growing old, while musically the band took up a more uptempo and aggressive sound. ""Humbug"" was a wild change in sound as the influence of new producer Josh Homme saw a mostly desert rock and psychedelic rock sound, and Turner's lyrics became more abstract and explored more cryptic themes than the straightforward, witty lines of their first two albums.  Their fourth album ""Suck It and See"" sees the band exploring styles, mixing them with newfound maturity. Turner said: ""I think the new album is a balance between our first three. There's nothing about taxi ranks or anything like that, but there's a bit of the standpoint I had on those early songs and the sense of humour, but also there's a bit of the 'Humbug' stuff which is kind of off in the corners."" Critics noted an influence from vintage British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as The Smiths, and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound. In a 2012 interview with ""NME"" magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon as a major influence lyrically. Speaking about Lennon, Turner said; ""I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I really wanted to be able to write an ""I Am The Walrus"" type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that"". The single ""Do I Wanna Know?"" and its B-side ""2013"" have been compared to the edgier sound of The Black Keys, with ""2013"" in particular being compared to their song ""Sinister Kid"". According to the band, the fifth album ""AM"" will be more hip-hop influenced. As Alex Turner stated in an interview with ""NME"", it's ""like a Dr Dre beat, but we've given it an Ike Turner bowl-cut and sent it galloping across the desert on a Stratocaster"". He also cited Outkast, Aaliyah and Black Sabbath as influences for the album. "
Black Sabbath," Black Sabbath  Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band has since experienced multiple line-up changes, with Tony Iommi the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a heavy blues rock band named Earth, the band began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with occult and horror themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war. Osbourne's heavy drug use led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. After a few albums with Dio's vocals and songwriting collaborations, Black Sabbath endured a revolving line-up in the 1980s and '90s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as multiple members of Deep Purple and Rainbow. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record ""Dehumanizer"". The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album ""Reunion"". Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, ""13"", which features all original members except Bill Ward, was released in June 2013. Black Sabbath are cited as pioneers of heavy metal. The band helped define the genre with releases such as ""Black Sabbath"" (1970), ""Paranoid"" (1970) and ""Master of Reality"" (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the ""Greatest Metal Band"" of all time, and placed second in VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" list. ""Rolling Stone"" magazine ranked them number 85 in their ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". They have sold over 15 million records in the United States and over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. History. Formation and early days (1968–69). Following the break-up of their previous band Mythology in 1968, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston, Birmingham. The two enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: ""Ozzy Zig Needs Gig – has own PA"". The new group was initially named The Polka Tulk Blues Band (after a cheap brand of talcum powder Osbourne saw in his mother's bathroom) and also featured slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne's, and saxophonist Alan ""Aker"" Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated) and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke. Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece. While the band was performing under the Earth title, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as ""The Rebel"", ""Song for Jim"", and ""When I Came Down"". The demo titled ""Song for Jim"" was in reference to Jim Simpson. Jim Simpson was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea & Symphony. Simpson was also a trumpet player for the group Locomotive. Simpson had recently opened a new pub named Henry's Blues House and offered to let Earth play some gigs in his club. The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth. In December 1968, Iommi abruptly left Earth to join Jethro Tull. Although his stint with the band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on ""The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus"" TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. ""It just wasn't right, so I left"", Iommi said. ""At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having a leader in the band, which was Ian Anderson's way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it."" While playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth, and decided to again change their name. A cinema across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 Mario Bava horror film ""Black Sabbath"" starring Boris Karloff. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was ""strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies."" Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called ""Black Sabbath"", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed. Making use of the musical tritone, also known as ""The Devil's Interval"", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track ""probably the most evil song ever written"". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films. ""Black Sabbath"" and ""Paranoid"" (1970–71). The band's first show as Black Sabbath was on August 30, 1969, in Workington. They were signed to Philips Records in November 1969, and released their first single, ""Evil Woman"" (a cover of a song by the band Crow) through Philips subsidiary Fontana Records in January 1970 at Trident Studios. Later releases were handled by Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, Vertigo Records. Black Sabbath's first major exposure came when the band appeared on John Peel's Top Gear radio show in 1969, performing ""Black Sabbath"", ""NIB"", ""Behind the Wall of Sleep"", and ""Sleeping Village"" to a national audience in Great Britain shortly before recording of their first album commenced. Although the ""Evil Woman"" single failed to chart, the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain. Iommi recalls recording live: ""We thought 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff."" ""Black Sabbath"" was released on Friday the 13th, February 1970. The album reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart, and following its US and Canadian release in May 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, the album reached number 23 on the ""Billboard"" 200, where it remained for over a year. While the album was a commercial success, it was widely panned by critics, with Lester Bangs dismissing the album in a ""Rolling Stone"" review as ""discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other's musical perimeters, yet never quite finding synch"". It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned, giving the band their first mainstream exposure. It has since been certified platinum in both US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and in the UK by British Phonographic Industry (BPI). To capitalise on their chart success in the US, the band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after ""Black Sabbath"" was released. The new album was initially set to be named ""War Pigs"" after the song ""War Pigs"", which was critical of the Vietnam War; however, Warner changed the title of the album to ""Paranoid"". The album's lead-off single ""Paranoid"" was written in the studio at the last minute. As Ward explains: ""We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom."" The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit. The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the ""Paranoid"" single, it made number one in the charts. The US release was held until January 1971, as the ""Black Sabbath"" album was still on the charts at the time of ""Paranoid""'s UK release. Black Sabbath subsequently toured America for the first time and played their first ever US show at a club called ""Ungano's"" at 210 West 70th Street in New York City. The album reached No. 12 in the US in March 1971, and would go on to sell four million copies in the US, with virtually no radio airplay. Like ""Black Sabbath"", the album was panned by rock critics of the era, but modern-day reviewers such as AllMusic's Steve Huey cite ""Paranoid"" as ""one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time"", which ""defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history"". The album was ranked at No. 131 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. ""Paranoid""s chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single ""Iron Man"". Although the single failed to reach the top 40, ""Iron Man"" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting US single until 1998's ""Psycho Man"". ""Master of Reality"" and ""Volume 4"" (1971–73). In February 1971, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of ""Paranoid"", the band were afforded more studio time, along with a ""briefcase full of cash"" to buy drugs. ""We were getting into coke, big time"", Ward explained. ""Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them, because you were just so out of it."" Production completed in April 1971, and in July the band released ""Master of Reality"", just six months after the US release of ""Paranoid"". The album reached the top ten in both the US and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months, eventually receiving platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century. ""Master of Reality"" contained Black Sabbath's first acoustic songs, alongside fan favourites such as ""Children of the Grave"" and ""Sweet Leaf"". Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable, with Lester Bangs delivering an ambivalent review of ""Master of Reality"" in ""Rolling Stone"", describing the closing song ""Children of the Grave"" as ""naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel – but in the tradition rock'n'roll ... The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath's got it"", yet the very same magazine would in 2003 place the album at number 300 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. Following the ""Master of Reality"" world tour in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: ""The band started to become very fatigued and very tired. We'd been on the road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think ""Master of Reality"" was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album."" In June 1972, the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the Record Plant. The recording process was plagued with problems, many as a result of substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song ""Cornucopia"" after ""sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs"", Ward was nearly fired from the band. ""I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just ... horrible"" Ward said. ""I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired"". The album was originally titled ""Snowblind"" after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to ""Black Sabbath Vol. 4"", with Ward stating ""There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really"". Black Sabbath's ""Volume 4"" was released in September 1972, and while critics were dismissive of the album upon release, it achieved gold status in less than a month, and was the band's fourth consecutive release to sell a million copies in the US. With more time in the studio, ""Volume 4"" saw the band starting to experiment with new textures, such as strings, piano, orchestration and multi-part songs. The song ""Tomorrow's Dream"" was released as a single—the band's first since ""Paranoid""—but failed to chart. Following an extensive tour of the US, the band travelled to Australia and New Zealand for the first time in 1973, and later mainland Europe. ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" and ""Sabotage"" (1973–76). Following the ""Volume 4"" world tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release. Pleased with the ""Volume 4"" album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a ""giant synthesiser"". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. ""Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on ""Volume 4"" and we really got discontent"" Iommi said. ""Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything."" After a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England, where they rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean. ""We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again."" While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,"" which set the tone for the new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on ""Volume 4"", new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings, and complex arrangements. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought in as a session player, appearing on ""Sabbra Cadabra."" In November 1973, Black Sabbath released the critically acclaimed ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"". For the first time in their career, the band began to receive favourable reviews in the mainstream press, with Gordon Fletcher of ""Rolling Stone"" calling the album ""an extraordinarily gripping affair,"" and ""nothing less than a complete success."" Later reviewers such as Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a ""masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection,"" while also displaying ""a newfound sense of finesse and maturity."" The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US, reaching number four on the UK charts, and number eleven in the US. The band began a world tour in January 1974, which culminated at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath appeared alongside 1970s rock and pop giants Deep Purple, Eagles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rare Earth, Seals & Crofts, Black Oak Arkansas, and Earth, Wind & Fire. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager Don Arden. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the US, Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation. Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from ""Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath"". ""We could've continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – ""Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath"" wasn't a rock album, really."" Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, ""Sabotage"" was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with ""Rolling Stone"" stating """"Sabotage"" is not only Black Sabbath's best record since ""Paranoid"", it might be their best ever"", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that ""the magical chemistry that made such albums as ""Paranoid"" and ""Volume 4"" so special was beginning to disintegrate"". ""Sabotage"" reached the top 20 in both the US and the UK, but was the band's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the US, only achieving Gold certification. Although the album's only single ""Am I Going Insane (Radio)"" failed to chart, ""Sabotage"" features fan favourites such as ""Hole in the Sky"", and ""Symptom of the Universe"". Black Sabbath toured in support of ""Sabotage"" with openers Kiss, but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band's record companies released a Greatest hits album without input from the band, titled ""We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll"". The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the US. ""Technical Ecstasy"" and ""Never Say Die!"" (1976–79). Black Sabbath began work for their next album at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, in June 1976. To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerry Woodruffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on ""Sabotage"". During the recording of ""Technical Ecstasy"", Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians. Recording of ""Technical Ecstasy"" was difficult, and by the time the album was completed Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain. ""Technical Ecstasy"", released on 25 September 1976, was met with mixed reviews. For the first time the reviews did not become more favourable as time passed; two decades after its release AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was ""unravelling at an alarming rate"". The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. ""Technical Ecstasy"" failed to reach the top 50 in the US, and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status, although it was later certified gold in 1997. The album included ""Dirty Women"", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song ""It's Alright"". Touring in support of ""Technical Ecstasy"" began in November 1976, with openers Boston and Ted Nugent in the US, and completed in Europe with AC/DC in April 1977. In late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album, and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their first and only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song ""Junior's Eyes"" on the BBC Television program ""Look! Hear!"". Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne wasn't fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. ""The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me"", Osbourne said. ""I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out."" Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the ""Look! Hear!"" footage still exist, Walker says he's not aware of them. Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project, which featured ex-Dirty tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. ""Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band,"" Iommi explained. ""He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick."" The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Canada, writing and recording what would become ""Never Say Die!"". ""It took quite a long time,"" Iommi said. ""We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day."" The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic stating two decades after its release that the album's ""unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse."" The album featured the singles ""Never Say Die"" and ""Hard Road"", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK, and the band made their second appearance on the ""Top of the Pops"", performing ""Never Say Die"". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US. Touring in support of ""Never Say Die!"" began in May 1978 with openers Van Halen. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance ""tired and uninspired"", a stark contrast to the ""youthful"" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time. The band filmed a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as ""Never Say Die"". The final show of the tour, and Osbourne's last appearance with the band (until later reunions) was in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 11 December. Following the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing drugs and alcohol, but Iommi says Osbourne ""was on a totally different level altogether"". The band would come up with new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. With pressure from the record label, and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. ""At that time, Ozzy had come to an end"", Iommi said. ""We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out."" Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on April 27, 1979. ""I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid,"" Ward said. ""Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic."" ""Heaven and Hell"" and ""Mob Rules"" (1979–82). Sharon Arden (later Sharon Osbourne), daughter of Black Sabbath manager Don Arden, suggested former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979. Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original lineup as the most profitable. Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. ""They were totally different altogether"", Iommi explains. ""Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing ""across"" the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in ""Iron Man"". Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing."" Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979, and, according to Dio, the band initially hired Craig Gruber (with whom Dio had previously played while in Elf) on bass to assist with writing the new album. Gruber was soon replaced by Geoff Nicholls of Quartz. The new line-up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980, and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by Martin Birch, ""Heaven and Hell"" was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release Allmusic said the album was ""one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout"". ""Heaven and Hell"" peaked at number 9 in the UK, and number 28 in the US, the band's highest charting album since ""Sabotage"". The album eventually sold a million copies in the US, and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980. Black Sabbath toured the US throughout 1980 with Blue Öyster Cult on the ""Black and Blue"" tour, with a show at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as ""Black and Blue"". On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles with Journey, Cheap Trick, and Molly Hatchet. The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 Day on the Green at Oakland Coliseum. While on tour, Black Sabbath's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year old performance, titled ""Live at Last"" without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the British charts, and saw the re-release of ""Paranoid"" as a single, which reached the top 20. On 18 August 1980, after a show in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Ward quit the band. ""It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated"". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where ""He might as well be a martian"". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward. The band completed the ""Heaven and Hell"" world tour in February 1981, and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album. Black Sabbath's second studio album produced by Martin Birch and featuring Ronnie James Dio as vocalist, ""Mob Rules"" was released in October 1981, to be well received by fans, but less so by the critics. ""Rolling Stone"" reviewer J. D. Considine gave the album one star, claiming """"Mob Rules"" finds the band as dull-witted and flatulent as ever"". Like most of the band's earlier work, time helped to improve the opinions of the music press, a decade after its release, Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called ""Mob Rules"" ""a magnificent record"". The album was certified gold, and reached the top 20 on the UK charts. The album's title track ""The Mob Rules"", which was recorded at John Lennon's old house in England, also featured in the 1981 animated film ""Heavy Metal"", although the film version is an alternate take, and differs from the album version. Unhappy with the quality of 1980's ""Live at Last"", the band recorded another live album—titled ""Live Evil""—during the ""Mob Rules"" world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. ""Ronnie wanted more say in things,"" Iommi said. ""And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. ""Live Evil"" is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'"". ""When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do,"" Dio later said. ""I refuse to listen to ""Live Evil"", because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny"". Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start his own band, and took drummer Vinny Appice with him. ""Live Evil"" was released in January 1983, but was overshadowed by Ozzy Osbourne's ""Speak of the Devil"", a platinum selling album. ""Born Again"" (1983–84). The two original members left, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, began auditioning new singers for the band's next release. Samson's Nicky Moore, and Lone Star's John Sloman were considered. The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982. While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath, pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name. The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums. ""Born Again"" was panned upon release by critics. Despite the negative reception of the album, it reached number four on the UK charts, and number 39 in the US. Even a decade after its release Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album ""dreadful"", noting that ""Gillan's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom"". Although he performed on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. ""I fell apart with the idea of touring,"" Ward later said. ""I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake."" Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the ""Born Again"" '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the US with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding the Deep Purple song ""Smoke on the Water"" to their set list. The tour in support of ""Born Again"" included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument. In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary ""This Is Spinal Tap"", the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. As Geezer Butler later explained: Hiatus and ""Seventh Star"" (1984–86). Following the completion of the ""Born Again"" tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like ""hired help"" by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. ""When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me"", Butler later said. ""I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it."" Following Butler's exit, sole remaining original member Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Black Sabbath line-up were offered a spot at Bob Geldof's Live Aid benefit concert; the band agreed, performing at the Philadelphia show, on 13 July 1985. The event marked the first time the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of The Who and Led Zeppelin. Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz and drummer Eric Singer, and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, ex-Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and ex-Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio, but this plan didn't work as he forecasted. ""We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album."" The band spent the remainder of the year in the studio, recording what would become ""Seventh Star"". Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as ""Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi"" in January 1986. ""It opened up a whole can of worms really,"" Iommi explained, ""because I think if we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more."" ""Seventh Star"", which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album ""often misunderstood and underrated"". The new line-up rehearsed for six weeks, preparing for a full world tour, although the band were eventually forced to use the Black Sabbath name. ""I was into the 'Tony Iommi project', but I wasn't into the Black Sabbath moniker,"" Hughes said. ""The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn't appeal to me ""whatsoever"". Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like James Brown singing in Metallica. It wasn't gonna work"". Just four days before the start of the tour, vocalist Glenn Hughes got into a bar fight with the band's production manager John Downing which splintered the singer's orbital bone. The injury interfered with Hughes' ability to sing, and the band brought in vocalist Ray Gillen to continue the tour with W.A.S.P. and Anthrax, although nearly half of the US dates would eventually be cancelled because of poor ticket sales. One vocalist whose status is disputed, both inside and outside Black Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman, Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt has insisted that he was a singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985. Tony Iommi has never confirmed this, as he was working on a solo release that was later named as a Sabbath album. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe-Young's book ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath"". ""The Eternal Idol"", ""Headless Cross"" and ""Tyr"" (1986–90). Black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at Air Studios in Montserrat with producer Jeff Glixman. The recording was fraught with problems from the beginning, as Glixman left after the initial sessions, and was replaced by producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven. Bassist Dave Spitz quit over ""personal issues"", and ex-Rainbow bassist Bob Daisley was brought in. Daisley re-recorded all of the bass tracks, and wrote the album's lyrics, but before the album was complete, he left to join Gary Moore's backing band, taking drummer Eric Singer with him. After problems with second producer Coppersmith-Heaven, the band returned to Morgan Studios in England in January 1987 to work with new producer Chris Tsangarides. While working in the UK, new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form Blue Murder with John Sykes. The band enlisted ex-Alliance vocalist Tony Martin to re-record Gillen's tracks, and former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan to complete a few percussion overdubs. Before the release of the new album, Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at Sun City, South Africa during the apartheid era. The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with Artists United Against Apartheid, who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985. Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows, and was replaced by Terry Chimes, formerly of The Clash. After nearly a year in production, ""The Eternal Idol"" was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. Allmusic said that ""Martin's powerful voice added new fire"" to the band, and the album contained ""some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years."" ""Blender"" gave the album two stars, claiming the album was ""Black Sabbath in name only"". The album would stall at No. 66 in the UK, while peaking at 168 in the US. The band toured in support of ""Eternal Idol"" in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece. Unfortunately, in part because of a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident, other European shows were cancelled. Bassist Dave Spitz left the band shortly before the tour, and was replaced by Jo Burt, formerly of Virginia Wolf. Following the poor commercial performance of ""The Eternal Idol"", Black Sabbath were dropped by Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with I.R.S. Records. The band took time off in 1988, returning in August to begin work on their next album. As a result of the recording troubles with ""Eternal Idol"", Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. ""It was a completely new start"", Iommi said. ""I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again"". Iommi enlisted ex-Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle, and rented a ""very cheap studio in England"". Black Sabbath released ""Headless Cross"" in April 1989, and this album was again ignored by contemporary reviewers. Eventually, Allmusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia would give the album four stars, calling ""Headless Cross"" ""the finest non-Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album"". Anchored by the number 62 charting single ""Headless Cross"", the album reached number 31 on the UK charts, and number 115 in the US. Queen guitarist Brian May, a good friend of Iommi's, played a guest solo on the song ""When Death Calls"". Following the album's release, the band added touring bassist Neil Murray, formerly of Whitesnake, Gary Moore's backing band, and Vow Wow. The ill-fated ""Headless Cross"" U.S. tour began in May 1989 with openers Kingdom Come and Silent Rage, but because of poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows. The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows, the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Girlschool. Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia, after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989. The band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record ""Tyr"", the follow-up to ""Headless Cross"". While not technically a concept album, some of the album's lyrical themes are loosely based on Norse mythology. ""Tyr"" was released on 6 August 1990, and reached number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the ""Billboard 200"" in the US. The album would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with Allmusic noting that the band ""mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis"", while ""Blender"" gave the album just one star, claiming that ""Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection"". The band toured in support of ""Tyr"" with Circus of Power in Europe, but the final seven UK dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales. For the first time in their career, the band's touring cycle did not include US dates. ""Dehumanizer"" (1990–92). While on his own ""Lock Up The Wolves"" US tour in August 1990, former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined on stage at the Minneapolis Forum by former Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to perform ""Neon Knights"". Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. ""I do regret that in a lot of ways"", Iommi said. ""We were at a good point then. We decided to with Dio and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had"". Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell in the fall of 1990 to begin working on the next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the ""Mob Rules"" era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio, and some songs were re-written multiple times. """"Dehumanizer"" took a long time, it was just hard work"", Iommi said. ""We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous"". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. ""It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works"", he said. ""Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album"". The resulting album, ""Dehumanizer"" was released on 22 June 1992. In the US, the album was released on 30 June 1992 by Reprise Records, as Ronnie James Dio and his namesake band were still under contract with the label at the time. While the album received mixed it was the band's biggest commercial success in a decade. Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single ""TV Crimes"", the album peaked at number 44 on the ""Billboard 200."" The album also featured the song ""Time Machine"", a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film ""Wayne's World"". Additionally, the perception by many fans of a return of some semblance of the ""real"" Black Sabbath provided the band with some much needed momentum. Black Sabbath began touring in support of ""Dehumanizer"" in July 1992 with Testament, Danzig, Prong, and Exodus. While on tour, former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne announced his first retirement, and invited Black Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his ""No More Tours"" tour in Costa Mesa, California. The band agreed, aside from vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who told Iommi in no uncertain terms ""I'm not doing that. I'm not supporting a clown."" Dio spoke of the situation in an interview years later: Dio quit Black Sabbath following a show in Oakland, California on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band. Iommi and Butler also joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985's ""Live Aid"" concert, performing a brief set of Black Sabbath songs. ""Cross Purposes"" and ""Forbidden"" (1993–96). Drummer Vinny Appice left the band following the reunion show to join Ronnie James Dio's solo band, later appearing on Dio's ""Strange Highways"" and ""Angry Machines"". Iommi and Butler enlisted former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli, and reinstated former vocalist Tony Martin. The band returned to the studio to work on new material, although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name. As Geezer Butler explains: Under pressure from their record label, the band released their seventeenth studio album, ""Cross Purposes"", on 8 February 1994, under the Black Sabbath name. The album received mixed reviews, with ""Blender"" giving the album two stars, calling Soundgarden's 1994 album ""Superunknown"" ""a far better Sabbath album than this by-the-numbers potboiler"". Allmusic's Bradley Torreano called ""Cross Purposes"" ""the first album since ""Born Again"" that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record"". The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41, and also reached 122 on the ""Billboard 200"" in the US. ""Cross Purposes"" contained the song ""Evil Eye"", which was co-written by Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, although uncredited because of record label restrictions. Touring in support of ""Cross Purposes"" began in February with Morbid Angel and Motörhead in the US. The band filmed a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 13 April 1994, which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD, titled ""Cross Purposes Live"". After the European tour with Cathedral and Godspeed in June 1994, drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Ward for five shows in South America. Following the touring cycle for ""Cross Purposes"", bassist Geezer Butler quit the band for the second time. ""I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing"". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released ""Plastic Planet"" in 1995. The album contained the song ""Giving Up the Ghost"", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: ""You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone"" (""I heard it's something about me…"" said Iommi. ""I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really paid any attention to the lyrics… It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend."" Following Butler's departure, newly returned drummer Ward once again left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass and Cozy Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the ""Tyr"" line-up. The band enlisted Body Count guitarist Ernie C to produce the new album, which was recorded in London in the fall of 1994. The album featured a guest vocal on ""Illusion of Power"" by Body Count vocalist Ice-T. The resulting ""Forbidden"" was released on 8 June 1995, but failed to chart in the US or the UK. The album was widely panned by critics; Allmusic's Bradley Torreano said ""with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan""; while ""Blender"" magazine called ""Forbidden"" ""an embarrassment ... the band's worst album"". Black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Motörhead and Tiamat, but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, and was replaced by former drummer Bobby Rondinelli. ""The members I had in the last lineup – Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray – they're great, great characters…"" Iommi told Sabbath fanzine ""Southern Cross"". ""That, for me, was an ideal lineup. I wasn't sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with."" After completing Asian dates in December 1995, Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Judas Priest drummer Dave Holland. The album was not officially released following its completion, although a widely traded bootleg called ""Eighth Star"" surfaced soon after. The album was officially released in 2004 as ""The 1996 DEP Sessions"", with Holland's drums re-recorded by session drummer Jimmy Copley. In 1997, Tony Iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line-up. Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line-up reunion had been in the works since the band's brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne's 1992 Costa Mesa show, and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.R.S. Records. Martin later recalled ""Forbidden"" as a ""filler album that got the band out of the label deal, rid of the singer, and into the reunion. However I wasn't privy to that information at the time"". I.R.S. Records released a compilation album in 1996 to fulfill the band's contract, titled ""The Sabbath Stones"", which featured songs from ""Born Again"" to ""Forbidden"". ""Reunion"" (1997–2006). In the summer of 1997, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Ozzy Osbourne officially reunited to co-headline the Ozzfest festival tour alongside Osbourne's solo band. The line-up featured Osbourne's drummer Mike Bordin filling in for Ward, who was unable to participate because of previous commitments with his solo project, The Bill Ward Band. In December 1997, the group was joined by Ward, marking the first reunion of the original four members since Osbourne's 1992 ""retirement show"". The original line-up recorded two shows at the Birmingham NEC, which were released as the double live album ""Reunion"" on 20 October 1998. ""Reunion"" reached number eleven on the ""Billboard 200"", and went platinum in the US. The album spawned the single ""Iron Man"", which won Black Sabbath its first and only Grammy award in 2000 for Best Metal Performance, 30 years after the song was originally released. ""Reunion"" also featured two new studio tracks, ""Psycho Man"" and ""Selling My Soul"", both of which cracked the top 20 on the ""Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks"" chart. Shortly before the band embarked on a European tour in the summer of 1998, Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice. Ward returned in time for the US tour with openers Pantera, which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour. Following the Ozzfest appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Tony Iommi released his first official solo album, ""Iommi"", in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on his next solo release, ""Down to Earth"". Black Sabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer Rick Rubin in the spring of 2001, but the sessions were halted when Osbourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer of 2001. ""It just came to an end"", Iommi said. ""We didn't go any further, and it's a shame because songs were really Iommi commented on the difficulty getting all of the band members together to work on material: In March 2002, Ozzy Osbourne's Emmy winning reality TV show ""The Osbournes"" debuted on MTV, and quickly became a worldwide hit. The show introduced Osbourne to a broader audience and to capitalise, the band's back catalogue label, Sanctuary Records released a double live album ""Past Lives"", which featured concert material recorded in the '70s, including the previously unofficial ""Live at Last"" album. The band remained on hiatus until the summer of 2004 when they returned to headline Ozzfest 2004 and 2005. In November 2005, Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and in March 2006, after eleven years of eligibility, the band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the awards ceremony Metallica played two Black Sabbath songs, ""Hole in the Sky"" and ""Iron Man"" in tribute to the band. ""The Dio Years"" and Heaven & Hell (2006–10). While Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006, Rhino Records released """", a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. ""The Dio Years"" was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the ""Billboard 200"", while the single ""The Devil Cried"" reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the ""Heaven and Hell"" era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with ""a couple of the band members"". He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the ""Mob Rules"" and ""Dehumanizer"" albums. Heaven & Hell toured the US with openers Megadeth and Machine Head, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled ""Live from Radio City Music Hall"". In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour, alongside Judas Priest, Motörhead and Testament. The box set, ""The Rules of Hell"", featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the name of their debut studio album, ""The Devil You Know"", released on 28 April. On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members. In March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with Metallica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day. It was released on 17 April 2010. Ronnie James Dio died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer. In June 2010, the legal battle between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi over the trademarking of the Black Sabbath name ended, but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. Reunion and ""13"" (2010–present). In a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography ""I Am Ozzy"", Osbourne stated that although he would not rule it out, he was doubtful there would be a reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: ""I'm not gonna say I've written it (a reunion) out forever, but right now I don't think there's any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine."" Butler said that there would be no reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band. On 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with a full tour in support beginning in 2012. Guitarist Iommi was diagnosed with lymphoma on 9 January 2012, which forced the band to cancel all but three shows (Birmingham, Download Festival, and Lollapalooza Festival) of a previously booked European tour. In February 2012, drummer Ward announced that he would not participate further in the band's reunion until he was offered a ""signable contract"". On 21 May 2012, at the O2 Academy in Birmingham, Black Sabbath played their first concert since 2005, with Tommy Clufetos playing the drums. In June, they performed at Download Festival, followed by the last concert of the short tour at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago. Later that month, the band started recording the album. On 13 January 2013, the band announced that the album would be released in June under the title ""13"". Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine was chosen as the drummer, and Rick Rubin was chosen as the producer. Mixing of the album commenced in February. On 12 April 2013, the band released the album's track listing. The standard version of the album features eight new tracks, and the deluxe version features three bonus tracks. The band's first single from ""13"", ""God Is Dead?"", was released on 19 April 2013. On 20 April 2013, Black Sabbath commenced their first Australia/New Zealand tour in 40 years, to be followed by a major U.S. tour in July and August 2013. The second single of the album, ""End of the Beginning"", debuted on 15 May in a """" episode, where all three members appeared. In June 2013, ""13"" topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US ""Billboard"" 200. In November, the band will start their European tour that will last until December. Musical style. Although Black Sabbath have gone through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their original sound focused on ominous lyrics and doomy music, often making use of the musical tritone, also called the ""devil's interval"". While their first two albums had slight compositional similarities to the progressive rock genre that was growing in popularity at the time, standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s Black Sabbath's dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era. Much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio. As the band's primary songwriter, Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath's music, while Osbourne would write vocal melodies, and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics. The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured to come up with new material. ""If I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything."" On Iommi's influence, Osbourne later said: Beginning with their third album, ""Master of Reality"", Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1966, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning. Legacy. Black Sabbath has sold over 70 million records worldwide, including a RIAA-certified 15 million in the US. They are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time. The band helped to create the genre with ground breaking releases such as ""Paranoid"", an album that ""Rolling Stone"" magazine said ""changed music forever"", and called the band ""the Beatles of heavy metal"". ""Time Magazine"" called ""Paranoid"" ""the birthplace of heavy metal"", placing it in their Top 100 Albums of All Time. ""Rolling Stone"" magazine ranked Black Sabbath number 85 in their list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time. MTV placed Black Sabbath at number one on their Top Ten Heavy Metal Bands and VH1 placed them at number two on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. VH1 ranked Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" the number one song on their 40 Greatest Metal Songs countdown. Allmusic's William Ruhlmann said: Influence and innovation. Black Sabbath have influenced many acts including Iron Maiden, Slayer, Metallica, Nirvana, Korn, Mayhem, Venom, Judas Priest, Guns N' Roses, Body Count, Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Disturbed, Death, Opeth, Pantera, Megadeth, The Smashing Pumpkins, Slipknot, Foo Fighters, Fear Factory, Candlemass, Godsmack, and Van Halen. Two gold selling tribute albums have been released, ""Nativity in Black Volume 1 & 2"", including covers by Sepultura, White Zombie, Type O Negative, Faith No More, Machine Head, Primus, Raven Lord, System of a Down, and Monster Magnet. They were also Grant Nicholas of Feeder's favourite band in high school. Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who, along with bandmate James Hetfield inducted Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said ""Black Sabbath is and always will be synonymous with heavy metal"", while Hetfield said ""Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff."" Ex-Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the ""Paranoid"" album: ""There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension ...""Paranoid"" is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style— doesn't matter whether it's off ""Paranoid"" or if it's off ""Heaven and Hell""— it's very distinctive."" Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said ""I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums."" Lamb of God's Chris Adler said: ""If anybody who plays heavy metal says that they weren't influenced by Black Sabbath's music, then I think that they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did."" Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: ""They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary."" On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: ""The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come."" Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that ""only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre"". In addition to being pioneers of heavy metal, they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres stoner rock, sludge metal, thrash metal, black metal, and doom metal as well as for alternative rock subgenre grunge. According to the critic Bob Gulla, the band's sound ""shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains"". Black Sabbath were also one of the earliest to turn gothic music into a genre. Tony Iommi has been credited as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips of his fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made. Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film ""Almost Famous"", Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication ""Trebuchet Magazine"" has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.

Sepsis," Sepsis Six  The Sepsis Six is the name given to a bundle of medical therapies designed to reduce the mortality of patients with sepsis. The Sepsis Six was developed in 2006 by a group of physicians and nurses (Daniels, Nutbeam, Laver) working on Survive Sepsis – an educational programme to raise awareness and improve the treatment of patients with sepsis.  Survive Sepsis' training programme was based around the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines and became the official educational package of both the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the UK Sepsis Trust. The Sepsis Six consists of three diagnostic and three therapeutic steps – all to be delivered within one hour of the initial diagnosis of sepsis.  Many centres throughout the world have since adopted the Sepsis Six, which has been associated with decreased mortality, decreased length of stay in hospital, and fewer intensive care bed days. "

In 2013, ""The Hollywood Reporter"" reported that ""sources familiar with his many business dealings"" estimated he would earn more than $35 million that year, with NBC paying him $10–12 million for each season of ""The Voice"". Early life. Levine was born in Los Angeles to Fred Levine, the founder of retail chain M. Fredric, and Patsy (née Noah) Levine, an admissions-counselor. Journalist and author Timothy Noah is his uncle. He has a younger brother, Michael, and a half-brother, Sam. Levine's parents divorced when he was seven. Growing up, he spent weekdays with his mother and weekends with his father. He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a ""waste of time"" explaining: ""parents couldn't accept the fact that I might have been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things you do when you find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy"". He attended Brentwood School, where he met Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden, his future bandmates. He also attended French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts Camp in Hancock, New York. Levine had tried drugs in his adolescence and, in an interview with Q magazine, said, ""I've done drugs. I smoked a lot of pot when I was younger. There is a place in this world for a little weed every once in a while. I've written songs after smoking a joint and it was good"". However, he emphasized that ""more often than not it's absolute garbage. Cocaine just shouldn't be. It's brought no good into the world I'm not saying, you should do drugs"". Levine has Jewish heritage on both sides of his family (his father and maternal grandfather were Jewish) and considers himself Jewish, though, according to ""The Jewish Chronicle"", who interviewed him, he ""has rejected formal religious practice for a more generalized, spiritual way of life"". He chose not to have a Bar Mitzvah as a child, explaining: ""I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in. They were trying to make a bunch of money, and that's fine. I just don't think it's the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and years and years and years of cultural heritage"". Kara's Flowers. In September 1995, Levine, along with Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick, another Brentwood High student, formed garage band Kara's Flowers. In 1997, the band was discovered while they were performing at a beach party in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen. Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob Cavallo. Levine later recalled: ""when you're 17, you're in high school, you're cocky, and you have people telling you you're going to be huge and giving you a bunch of money and all that. You're like, 'Sweet. Cool. We're going to be famous. Our problems are going to be solved.'"" In 1997, Kara's Flowers released their first album titled ""The Fourth World"". That same year, the band appeared on an episode of the drama series ""Beverly Hills, 90210"". Despite high expectations, the album had little success, selling about 5,000 copies, and its only single, ""Soap Disco"", failed commercially. Later, Levine would say of the band: ""Kara’s Flowers was just floating up the wall beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly, put it out. No touring base, no nothing. Just try to make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesn’t work"". Disappointed with the results of their album, the band broke up. Maroon 5 and mainstream success. After the break-up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles for New York. On ""MTV News"", in 2002, he said: ""That's when I started waking up to the whole hip hop, R&B thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was ""not"" Brentwood High"". While in New York, he worked a two-week stint as a waiter at Johnny Rockets. After dropping out of Five Towns College, where he and Carmichael had enrolled to study music, they reunited with Madden and Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum. Under Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, former Square guitarist James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine ""seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer , so he could be the star I perceived him to be"". ""Songs About Jane"" became the tenth best-selling album of 2004, two years after its release. Over the next three years, the band toured extensively, including visits to seventeen countries. In 2005, Maroon 5 won their first Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The next year, they won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the second ""Songs About Jane"" single ""This Love"". By 2006, they started recording once again, and in May 2007, Maroon 5's second album ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"" was released. Levine described the album as a ""a vast improvement"", explaining: ""I think this record is a little more self-confident and powerful lyrically"". To support the album, the band performed on a ""six-date club tour"" in which they visited small venues in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, and New York City in early June 2007. The album and its lead, third and penultimate singles (""Makes Me Wonder"", ""Won't Go Home Without You"" and ""If I Never See Your Face Again"" respectively) each won Grammy nominations, although only ""Makes Me Wonder"" secured a win. After winding down from a world tour in support ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"", the band began recording in Switzerland in 2009, in collaboration with record producer and songwriter Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange. Levine said of working with Lange: ""He worked me harder than anyone ever has ... I would come in with a finished song, and he'd say, 'That's a good start. Now strip it down to the drums and start over.' The coolest thing about him is that not only has he been a huge, legendary producer, but he also is a legit, serious writer"". In 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album, ""Hands All Over"". The album did not initially meet expectations. In an interview with ""Los Angeles Times"" Levine explained that the album ""was such a hodgepodge — all these disparate ideas and songs that didn't make any sense together ... Switzerland's neutrality is very famous, and I feel like that neutrality infected Maroon 5's third album"". After the moderate success of the album's first three singles, the band released ""Moves like Jagger"" which Levine classified as ""one of those songs that was definitely a risk; it's a bold statement"". Despite this, the single became a success worldwide, it was the ninth-best-selling digital single of 2011 with sales of 8.5 million copies and, as of 2012, the eighth-best-selling digital single of all time. Levine later credited the song with ""totally reviving the band"". Since ""Moves Like Jagger"" was the first time Maroon 5 had collaborated with an outside writer, the band decided to attempt it again on their next album, entitled ""Overexposed"". Its title is supposedly an allusion to Levine's ubiquity. In an interview for Rolling Stone, he opined that is their most dance-driven album ever, commenting: ""It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it – but mostly I love it"". The album and its lead single ""Payphone"" gave Maroon 5 their second Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance nominations. In support of ""Overexposed"", the band conducted the Overexposed Tour from 2012-13 (with the European leg extending to 2014 due to scheduling conflicts), and also headlined the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour, which included ""The Voice"" contestant Tony Lucca. In 2008, Levine had hinted that he was apprehensive about his future with Maroon 5, saying: ""I've spent my 20s on tour and there’s no consistency in my life, which can take its toll. Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond, like the Rolling Stones"". However, he emphasized that he didn't ""want to give it up just yet, though – I think we have a little more to say"". He has also turned down the idea of having a solo career, stating that ""there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band"". Other work. Musical collaborations. Levine has collaborated with several various music artists. In 2005, he was featured on the Ying Yang Twins song ""Live Again"". He appeared on Kanye West's ""Late Registration"" album, on the third single, ""Heard 'Em Say"". He is also featured in the song ""Wild Horses"" on Alicia Keys' third album ""Alicia Keys: MTV Unplugged"". Over the next year, he co-wrote the track ""Say It Again"" on Natasha Bedingfield's album ""N.B."" and also performed the background vocals on the song. Around the same time, he also featured on fellow Octone Records singer K'naan's single ""Bang Bang"". In 2009, he recorded ""Gotten"", a song for Slash's first solo album ""Slash"" released in April 2010. In February 2010, he was among approximately 80 musicians who sang on the charity-single remake of ""We Are the World"" called ""We Are the World 25 for Haiti"".

He is also featured as a singer for his band's song ""She Will Be Loved"" in the music rhythm game ""Band Hero"". He appeared in Sara Bareilles's music video for her single Uncharted. TV and media. Levine has made four notable comic appearances on television. During 2007, he appeared in the 33rd season premiere of ""Saturday Night Live"" in an SNL Digital Short called ""Iran So Far"" with Andy Samberg, Fred Armisen and Jake Gyllenhaal. Levine played himself while singing a humorous bridge to a ""love song"" for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In 2008, he appeared on Comedy Central's ""Night of Too Many Stars"". He also had a cameo on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" for the night of stars and endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election. In 2013, he hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" and featured on Lonely Island's digital short ""YOLO"". In 2012, Levine appeared as a recurring character in , the second season of the anthology series. In it, he plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with wife Teresa, played by Jenna Dewan-Tatum. The scenes were shot around his summer touring schedule. In an interview with E! Online, he said of his role: ""It sounded like so much fun and that's why I wanted to do it. I was like, this doesn't even sound like acting; this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley"". In May 2013, Levine, along with manager Jordan Feldstein, inked a first-look deal with NBC to create scripted and alternative programming for the network to serve as series and specials. In August that year, NBC picked up a script for a semi-autobiographical single-camera sitcom, based on a younger Levine and his roommate, Korean-American writer Gene Hong, who will pen the pilot. The entry will be produced by Universal Television and 222 Productions, and will go into production in late 2013. Levine stripped naked for testicular cancer awareness for a centerfold in ""Cosmopolitan"" UK's February 2011 issue. He was ranked #41 on ""Glamour Magazine's"" ""Sexiest Men of 2012"" list.

In April 2012, ""Shalom Life"" ranked him Number 7 on its list of “Top 50 Hottest Jewish men in the world"". In June 2012, Levine was cast in the musical romance-drama film ""Can a Song Save Your Life?"", directed by John Carney and starring Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo. He plays Knightely's former love interest in the movie. Business ventures and endorsements. In October 2008, Levine collaborated with First Act to create the First Act 222 Guitar, fashioned to his specifications. The guitar was made available for purchase at Target retail stores. Levine launched his own fashion line, entitled ""222"", at the Project Trade Show in Las Vegas in August 2010. The collection is a minimalistic line of jeans, basic T-shirts and leather jackets, a style he described as ""simple and pure and durable"". The venture was organized in partnership with his father, Fred Levine, who operates a chain of specialty boutiques, and his cousin, Sami Cooper. Levine explained that ""this is a family affair ... what I wanted to avoid was the typical pitfalls that someone in my position can fall into. This is something grassroots"". In June 2011, Levine took part in an educational campaign to raise awareness of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The project, titled ""Own It"", was created by Shire and organized in collaboration with the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). The project targets young adults and adults who were previously diagnosed with ADHD, focusing on how ADHD may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager, said, ""This campaign is important to me because it can help young adults and adults realize that there's a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid"". Levine founded his own record label, 222 Records, in February 2012. ""Glee"" actor Matthew Morrison, Mexican artist Diego Boneta, and ""The Voice"" contestant Tony Lucca and Rozzi Crane, were subsequently signed to it. On its inception, he said: ""Starting my own label has been a long-time goal of mine and I am thrilled to be at the point in my career where it is finally happening"". It was reported that he was negotiating further with potential distributors, as well as organizing staff, to operate as a full-fledged record company with departments such as marketing, radio and publicity. In 2013, Levine collaborated with ID Perfumes to create his debut eponymous scent. The line was launched at the Premiere Fragrance Installation in Los Angeles in February 2013. The fragrance range, consisting of scents for both for men and women, is sold through Macy's department stores in microphone-shaped bottles. Speaking at its launch, he said: ""The task was to make something that I would wear. So that was a process and we finally came to a great conclusion and it smells great"". The fragrance garnered media attention for contradicting his tweet the previous year, in which he said that he wanted to ""put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward"". In 2013, it was announced that Levine would be entering a long-term partnership with Sears Holdings to launch a multi-department lifestyle brand to develop apparel and accessories collections for both men and women. The company, which owns Kmart and ShopYourWay, a shopping social platform, also included rapper Nicki Minaj in the same contract. In an official statement, he said: ""Partnering with ShopYourWay to develop this line was an exciting opportunity for me and I am really looking forward to diving into the process of designing an apparel and accessory collection"". In an interview with ""People"", he commented further, ""it was cool that they really promoted creative control. I like to be involved with process rather than just phoning it in. I want to make sure that every stitch is something that I approve of"". He also confirmed that fans would be able to take part in the design process. Artistry. Levine's interest in music started at around 10 years of age, when he first started playing the guitar. He found music an outlet for feelings, explaining: ""When I was in high school, I was a little rebellious. I didn't want to do the things they were teaching me. I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so madly in love with it, it's all I did."" He aspired to be in a band since an young age. He performed his first professional jig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but was so nervous he played with his back to the audience. Throughout his childhood, he had been influenced by the diverse groups like the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. He also incorporates Police and Prince into his music. In a ""Billboard"" interview, he explained the diversity of his influences: ""I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s."" Levine has a tenor vocal range and has been noted for his falsettos. Salon wrote: ""When he’s crooning come-ons, his voice lends the music a satisfying lewdness, a sense of sticky physicality that gives his snaky hooks a pheromonal urgency."" In an ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"" review, ""Entertainment Weekly"" commented his vocals were a ""smug, R&B-slick deadpan ... there's a twisted logic to his dispassionate delivery"" In another review, Allmusic noted that ""he knows that he's a pop guy, somewhat in the tradition of Hall & Oates, but he isn't trying to be retro, he's [...] making records that are melodic, stylish, and soulful."" Levine remembers listening to ""Are You That Somebody?"" by Aaliyah convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than his then-band Kara's Flowers. His move to New York introduced him to a new music scene that involved  hip-hop, R&B, gospel and soul music. He took to changing his musical style, extensively emulating Stevie Wonder. Subsequently, Songs About Jane was released, deemed ""bluesy funk"" and similar to Busted's music. Critics also drew comparisons between him and singer Jay Kay. Maroon 5 continued to work without any prominent outside collaborators until 2010's ""Moves Like Jagger"", the band's most successful single to date, which symbolized a dramatic shift in their music. While earlier work was deemed ""vaguely funky white-soul"" and ""rock"", recent ones were judged to have a more reggae, anthemic pop sound, and ""top shelf radio sucrose"" evoking comparisons to Coldplay. He himself refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: ""There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way. Hence, our sound has changed because we just like everything. It's maybe a little poppier than when we started. It was more R&B in the beginning."" He also considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: ""Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't figured out a way to use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing."" He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a ""Rolling Stone"" interview: ""I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach."" Levine's increasing media presence and the band's new direction have led some to comment that Maroon 5's sound has become too overproduced and no longer sound like a band. Personal life. Levine resides in the Hollywood Hills with his close friend Gene Hong, a Korean American writer, actor and producer. His house featured on the ""Architectural Digest"" in 2012. In September 2010, Levine said on the radio program ""The Howard Stern Show"" he had been dating Russian ""Sports Illustrated"" swimsuit and Victoria's Secret model Anne Vyalitsyna seriously for about eight months. The couple met when Maroon 5 performed at the 2010 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue release party in Las Vegas. In April 2012, Levine and Vyalitsyna announced that they had split. He then began dating Namibian Victoria's Secret model Behati Prinsloo in May 2012 . Levine and Prinsloo split up in March 2013 but in July 2013, it was confirmed that Levine and Prinsloo are engaged. Levine, whose brother openly identifies as gay, is an outspoken supporter of same-sex marriage and LGBT rights. In 2011, he made a video on Maroon 5's official YouTube account in support of the It Gets Better Project. In January 2012, he announced that Maroon 5 had changed the location of their post-Grammy Awards show because of the ""unnamed Los Angeles restaurant's backing of Proposition 8"". Levine practices yoga under yoga instructor Chad Dennis and has stated that it helps ""physically relax"" him. His yoga regime is a mixture of Ashtanga, Viny?sa, Jivamukti, Iyengar and Anusara yoga. In 2013, Levine was mentioned in a hostile work environment lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by an unnamed security guard who claimed that Universal Music Publishing Group’s Santa Monica location were ""infiltrated with pervasive drug use where you could smell marijuana seeping from various offices and openly used in common areas, and lounges"". The guard claimed that when she complained about the weed smoke coming from one of the studios, she was told that ""it's Adam Levine. You know from Maroon 5 ... He can do whatever he wants ... If he wants to come to the lobby and do a line of cocaine on the floor, it's OK"". In an official statement to ""The Hollywood Reporter"", UMPG described the allegations as ""absurd"". "
